/**

 *
 * It contains the minimal code required to bootstrap the agent without causing any implicit initializations of anything
 * related to the agent, including agent classes loading and linkage.
 * The bootstrap sequence includes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         bootstrap checks to abort initialization if required (can be disabled through the
 *         {@code elastic.apm.disable_bootstrap_checks} System property).
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         load the {@code co.elastic.apm.agent.bci.ElasticApmAgent} class and execute the agent initialization process
 *         <b>through reflection</b>. This can be done synchronously, blocking the bootstrapping thread (default); or
 *         asynchronously on a different thread with the {@code elastic.apm.start_async} System property (since 1.29.0);
 *         or asynchronously on a different thread after some delay, by configuring the
 *         {@code elastic.apm.delay_agent_premain_ms} System property with some positive value.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
