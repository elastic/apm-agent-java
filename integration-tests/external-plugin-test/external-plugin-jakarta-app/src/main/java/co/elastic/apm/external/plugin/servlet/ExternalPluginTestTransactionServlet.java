 * This Servlet demonstrates a full integration test through a webapp that is tested on all Servlet containers in
 * `integration-tests/application-server-integration-tests` (see {@code ExternalPluginTestApp}). When tested this way,
 * the plugin is loaded as a jar from the configured plugin directory, including the instrumentation class itself and
 * the META-INF/services/co.elastic.apm.agent.sdk.ElasticApmInstrumentation file.
 *
 * Since the path corresponding this Servlet is ignored, a transaction is created through the Servlet instrumentation.
 * Therefore, the instrumented method ({@link TestClass#traceMe(boolean)}) invocation targeted by the external plugin
 * should be captured as a transaction.
