/**
 * As the classes of an instrumentation plugins may be loaded from multiple plugin class loaders,
 * there's a need to share global state between those class loaders.
 * <p>
 * An alternative to this is {@link GlobalState} which can be used to make a whole class scoped globally.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Be careful not to store classes from the target class loader or the plugin class loader in a global variable.
 * This would otherwise lead to class loader leaks.
 * That's because a global variable is referenced from the agent class loader.
 * If it held a reference to a class that's loaded by the plugin class loader, the target class loader (such as a webapp class loader)
 * is held alive by the following chain of hard references:
 * {@code Map of global thread locals (Agent CL) -plugin class instance-> -plugin class-> plugin CL -(parent)-> webapp CL}
