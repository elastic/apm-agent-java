/**
 * Annotating a class with {@link GlobalState} excludes it from being loaded by the plugin class loader.
 * It will instead be loaded by the agent class loader.
 * This will make its static variables globally available instead of being local to the plugin class loader.
 * <p>
 * Normally, all classes within an instrumentation plugin are loaded from a dedicated class loader
 * that is the child of the class loader that contains the instrumented classes.
 * If there are multiple class loaders that are instrumented with a given instrumentation plugin,
 * the instrumentation classes will also be loaded by multiple class loaders.
 * The effect of that is that state added to static variables in one class loader does not affect the static variable in other class loaders.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An alternative to this is {@link GlobalVariables} which can be used to make individual variables scoped globally.
