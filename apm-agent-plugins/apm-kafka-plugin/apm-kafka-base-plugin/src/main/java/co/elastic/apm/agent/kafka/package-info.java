/**
 * Kafka tracing includes two parts in general:
 * 1. Visibility to record production and consumption events, including relevant metadata
 * 2. Distributed tracing
 * <p>
 * Capturing of record production events is trivial- can only be traced as a span within a traced transaction.
 * Consumption is a bit trickier as it relies on the {@link org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer#poll}
 * API. The challenge with polling APIs is that their invocation event is typically arbitrary (meaning their
 * duration is not of interest) and we really want to trace what happens AFTER they exit with a Message. Since Kafka
 * records are only consumed in {@link java.lang.Iterable} batches, we try to trace the actions executed between
 * iterations by starting/activating and ending/deactivating a transaction for each record during iteration.
 * Such transactions will have the {@code messaging} type. This may result in non-desirable traces, for example if the
 * iterator is held and not immediately iterated all through, but we assume this is somewhat of an edge case.
 * As long as we can make it safe from memory leaks, this is acceptable.
 * In case the polling is executed from within a traced transaction, we won't create a transaction-per-record. Instead,
 * we will trace the polling action itself and create a span for it.
 * <p>
 * For both produce and consume events, we capture and trace the topic name.
 * For kafka transactions, we capture record value (as long as the defined deserializer outputs text; configurable
 * through `capture_body`, off by default) and record headers as well (if they are UTF-8 encoded; configurable through
 * `capture_headers`, on by default).
 * <p>
