/**
 * Based on brave.servlet.ServletRuntime$TracingAsyncListener (under Apache license 2.0)
 *
 * onComplete is always called, even if onError/onTimeout is called, as per the specifications.
 * However, when onError/onTimeout is called, the Response that can be obtained through the event arg is not yet set with the right
 * status code, for that we need to rely on onComplete. On the the other hand, the event arg that is received in onComplete does not
 * contain the Throwable that comes with the event in the preceding onError, so we need to keep it.
 *
 * After testing on Payara, WildFly, Tomcat, WebSphere Liberty and Jetty, here is a summary of subtle differences:
 *  - Liberty is the only one that will invoke onError following an AsyncListener.start invocation with a Runnable that ends with Exception
 *  - WildFly will not resume the Response until timed-out in the same scenario, but it invokes onTimeout, which is good for our tests
 *  - Jetty on the same scenario will just go crazy endlessly trying to run the Runnable over and over
 *  - Some containers may release the response after onError/onTimeout to return to the client, meaning that onComplete is called afterwards
 *  - Jetty fails to invoke onError after AsyncContext.dispatch to a Servlet that ends with ServletException
 *  - JBoss EAP 6.4 does not invoke onComplete after onError is invoked
