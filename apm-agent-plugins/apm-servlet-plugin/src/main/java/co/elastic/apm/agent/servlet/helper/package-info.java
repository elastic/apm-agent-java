/**
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package are loaded by a class loader which is a child of the class loader the Servlet API is loaded from.
 * This works around the problem that the agent does not have access to the Servlet API.
 * Instead of injecting the helper classes to the same class loader the Servlet API is loaded from,
 * which will most likely not be possible anymore as of Java 11
 * (see http://jdk.java.net/11/release-notes#JDK-8193033),
 * we create a class loader as the child of the one which loads the Servlet API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The classes loaded by this helper class loader can then access the Servlet API.
 * However, the agent itself can't directly access the classes from the helper class loader,
 * because they are loaded by a child class loader.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This problem is circumvented by the agent providing an interface,
 * which the helper class implements.
 * The agent does then not need to know about the implementation type of the interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * One thing to be aware of is that the helper class loader needs to implement child first semantics when loading classes.
 * Otherwise, it would load the helper implementation from the system or bootstrap classloader (where the agent is loaded from),
 * without access to the Servlet API,
 * instead of loading them itself so that the helper classes can access the Servlet API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Advices have to manually add their required helper classes to {@link co.elastic.apm.agent.bci.HelperClassManager},
 * which takes care of creating the helper class loaders.
 * </p>
