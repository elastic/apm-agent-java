/**
 * This matcher is used in {@link co.elastic.apm.configuration.WebConfiguration#ignoreUrls}
 * to disable tracing for certain URLs.
 * <p>
 * The advantage of this class is that it does not instantiate objects when calling {@link #matches(String)}.
 * The syntax should be very familiar to any developer.
 * The only thing that might be surprising is that it does not support wildcards in between like <code>foo*bar</code>.
 * However, this provides support for the most common use cases -
 * ignoring URLs paths starting with a specific string like <code>/resources/*</code> or <code>/heartbeat/*</code>
 * and ignoring URLs by file ending like <code>*.js</code>.
 * It also allows to have a single configuration option which,
 * depending on the input string,
 * allows for prefix, postfix and infix matching.
 * This implementation is also very fast,
 * as it just resorts to {@link String#startsWith(String)},
 * {@link String#endsWith(String)} and {@link String#contains(CharSequence)}.
 * </p>

/*
 * Alternatives:
 *
 * Spring's AntPathMatcher:
 * This provides a more powerful glob-syntax to specify URL patterns.
 * The downside is that it allocates about 4bytes on every invocation,
 * depending on the concrete pattern.
 * Also, it is slower by a factor of ~100 compared to this class.
 *
 * Regular expressions:
 * Similar downsides to the AntPathMatcher -
 * it allocates objects on each invocation and has a higher latency.
 *
 * Elasticsearch's Regex#simpleMatch method:
 * It works quite similar to this class but also supports wildcards in the middle.
 * However, it also allocates objects while performing the match by calling {@link String#substring(int)},
 * which is something we want to avoid in the agent.
 * See https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v6.2.3/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/regex/Regex.java#L87
