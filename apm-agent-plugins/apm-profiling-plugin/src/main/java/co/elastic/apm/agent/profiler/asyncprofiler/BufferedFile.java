/**
 * An abstraction similar to {@link MappedByteBuffer} that allows to read the content of a file with an API that is similar to
 * {@link ByteBuffer}.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class hold a reusable buffer that contains a subset of the file,
 * or the whole file if the buffer's capacity is greater or equal to the file's size.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Whenever calling a method like {@link #getLong()} or {@link #position(long)} would exceed the currently buffered range
 * the same buffer is filled with a different range of the file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The downside of {@link MappedByteBuffer} (and the reason for implementing this abstraction)
 * is that calling methods like {@link MappedByteBuffer#get()} can increase time-to-safepoint.
 * This is because these methods are implemented as JVM intrinsics.
 * When the JVM executes an intrinsic, it does not switch to the native execution context which means that it's not ready to enter a safepoint
 * whenever a intrinsic runs.
 * As reading a file from disk can get stuck (for example when the disk is busy) calling {@link MappedByteBuffer#get()} may take a while to execute.
 * While it's executing other threads have to wait for it to finish if the JVM wants to reach a safe point.
 * </p>
