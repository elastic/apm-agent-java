[[supported-technologies-details]]
== Supported technologies
The Elastic APM Java agent automatically instruments various APIs,
frameworks and application servers.
This section lists all supported technologies.

If your favorite technology is not supported yet,
you can vote for it by participating in our
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd0RYiwZGrEuxykYkv9z8Hl3exx_LKCtjsqEo1OWx8BkLrOQ/viewform?usp=sf_link[survey].
We will use the results to add support for the most requested technologies.

Another option is to add a dependency to the agent's <<public-api, public API>>
in order to programmatically create custom transactions and spans.

If you want to extend the auto-instrumentation capabilities of the agent,
the https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[contributing guide] should get you started.

NOTE: If, for example,
the HTTP client library of your choice is not listed,
it means that there won't be spans for those outgoing HTTP requests.
If the web framework you are using is not supported,
the agent does not capture transactions.

[[supported-web-frameworks]]
=== Web Frameworks
|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description

|Servlet API
|3+
|A transaction will be created for all incoming HTTP requests to your Servlet API-based application.
 See also <<supported-app-servers>>

|Spring Web MVC
|4.x, 5.x
|If you are using Spring MVC (for example with Spring Boot),
  the transactions are named based on your controllers (`ControllerClass#controllerMethod`).

|Spring Boot
|1.5+, 2.x
|Supports embedded Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow

|JAX-RS
|2.x
|The transactions are named based on your resources (`ResourceClass#resourceMethod`).
 Note that only the packages configured in <<config-application-packages>> are scanned for JAX-RS resources.
 If you don't set this option,
 all classes are scanned.
 This comes at the cost of increased startup times, however.

 Note: JAX-RS is only supported when running on a supported <<supported-app-servers, Application Server/Servlet Container>>.

[float]
[[supported-app-servers]]
=== Application Servers/Servlet Containers
The Elastic APM Java agent has generic support for the Servlet API 3+.
However, some servers require special handling.
The servers listed here are tested by an integration test suite to make sure Elastic APM is compatible with them.
Other Servlet 3+ compliant servers will most likely work as well.

|===
|Server |Supported versions

|<<setup-tomcat,Tomcat>>
|7.x, 8.5.x, 9.x

|<<setup-wildfly,WildFly>>
|8-13

|<<setup-jetty,Jetty>> (only the `ServletContextHandler` is supported)
|9.2, 9.3, 9.4

|<<setup-websphere-liberty,WebSphere Liberty>>
|8.5.5, 18.0.x

|<<setup-generic,Undertow Servlet>>
|1.4

|<<setup-payara,Payara>>
|4.x, 5.x

[[supported-databases]]
=== Data Stores
|===
|Database |Supported versions | Description

|JDBC
|4.1+
|The agent automatically creates DB spans for all your JDBC queries.
 This includes JDBC queries executed by O/R mappers like Hibernate.

 *Note:* Make sure that your JDBC driver is at least compiled for Java 1.6.
 For example, commons dbcp versions before 1.4 are not supported.
 IBM DB2 db2jcc drivers are also not supported.
 Please update to db2jcc4.

|Elasticsearch
|5.0.2+
|The agent automatically creates Elasticsearch spans for queries done through the official REST client.
 *Currently, the `*Async` methods are not supported, only their synchronous counterparts.*

|===

[float]
[[supported-networking-frameworks]]
=== Networking frameworks
Distributed tracing will only work if you are using one of the supported networking frameworks.

|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description

|Apache HttpClient (<<config-disable-instrumentations,incubating>>)
|4.3+
|The agent automatically creates spans for outgoing HTTP requests and propagates tracing headers.
 The spans are named after the schema `<method> <host>`.

|Spring RestTemplate
|4+
|The agent automatically creates spans for outgoing HTTP requests and propagates tracing headers.
 The spans are named after the schema `<method> <host>`.

[[supported-technologies-caveats]]
=== Caveats
* Tracing of asynchronous invocations (for example `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`) is currently not supported.
* Certain OSGi containers need the following configuration setting in case you see exceptions like
  `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: co/elastic/apm/jdbc/StatementInstrumentation`:
  `org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation=co.elastic.apm.*`
* Other JVM languages, like Scala, Kotlin and Groovy have not been tested yet.
* The agent does currently not support running on JVMs with an enabled `SecurityManager`.
  You may see exceptions like this: `java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.lang.RuntimePermission" "getProtectionDomain")`
