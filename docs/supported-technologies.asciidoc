== Supported technologies
The Elastic APM Java Agent automatically instruments various APIs,
frameworks and application servers.
This section lists all supported technologies.

If your favorite technology is not supported yet,
you can vote for it by participating in our
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd0RYiwZGrEuxykYkv9z8Hl3exx_LKCtjsqEo1OWx8BkLrOQ/viewform?usp=sf_link[survey].
We will use the results to add support for the most requested technologies.

Other options are to add a dependency to the agent's <<public-api, public API>>
in order to programmatically create custom transactions and spans, or to create
your own <<plugin-api,plugin>> that will instrument the technology you want instrumented.

If you want to extend the auto-instrumentation capabilities of the agent,
the https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[contributing guide] should get you started.

NOTE: If, for example,
the HTTP client library of your choice is not listed,
it means that there won't be spans for those outgoing HTTP requests.
If the web framework you are using is not supported,
the agent does not capture transactions.

{empty}* Java 7 support is deprecated and will be removed in a future release

**Early Java 8 and Java 7**

Early Java 8 versions before update 40 are *not supported* because they have
several bugs that might result in JVM crashes when a java agent is active,
thus agent *will not start* on those versions.
Similarly, Java 7 versions before update 60 are not supported as they are buggy in regard to invokedynamic.

Here is an example of the message displayed when this happens.
```
Failed to start agent - JVM version not supported: 1.8.0_31 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 25.31-b07.
To override Java version verification, set the 'elastic.apm.disable_bootstrap_checks' System property to 'true'.
```

As this message states, you can disable this check if required by adding `-Delastic.apm.disable_bootstrap_checks` to
the JVM arguments.

=== Web Frameworks
|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description | Since

|Servlet API
|3+
|A transaction will be created for all incoming HTTP requests to your Servlet API-based application.

[float]
==== Distributed Tracing

The Java agent instrumentation for messaging system clients includes both senders and receivers.
When an instrumented client sends a message within a traced transaction, a `send` span is created. In addition, if the messaging system
supports message/record headers/annotations, the agent would add the `tracecontext` headers to enable distributed tracing.

On the receiver side, instrumented clients will attempt to create the proper distributed trace linkage in one of several ways, depending
on how messages are received:

* _Passive message handling:_ when the message handling logic is applied by implementing a passive message listener API (like
`javax.jms.MessageListener#onMessage` for example), creating the receiver transaction is mostly straightforward as the instrumented API
method invocation encapsulates message handling. Still, there are two use cases to consider:
** _Single message handling:_ when the message listener API accepts a single message, the agent would create a `messaging` typed
transaction per each received message, as a child transaction of the `send` span that corresponds the received message and with the same
trace ID
** _Batch message handling:_ when the message listener API accepts a batch of messages (like
`org.springframework.amqp.core.MessageListener.onMessageBatch` for example), the agent will create a single root transaction (i.e.
different trace ID from any of the `send` spans) by default to encapsulate the entire batch handling. The batch processing transaction
would be of `messaging` type, containing links__*__ to all `send` spans that correspond the messages in the batch. This can be changed
through the (non-documented) `message_batch_strategy` config option, which accepts either `BATCH_HANDLING` (default) or `SINGLE_HANDLING`
to enable the creation of a single child transaction per message.
* _Active message polling:_ in some cases, message are consumed from the broker through active polling.
Whenever the polling action occurs while there is already an active span, the agent will create a `poll` span and add span links__*__ to
it for each message returned by the poll action that contains `tracecontext` headers.
Since such polling APIs don't provide any indication as to when message handling actually occurs, the agent needs to apply some
heuristics in order to trace message handling. There are two use cases to consider in this type of message receiving as well:
** _Polling returns a single message:_ in such cases, the agent may apply assumptions with regard to the threads that execute the message
handling logic in order to determine when handling starts and ends. Based on that, it would create a transaction per consumed message. If
the consumed message contains the `tracecontext` headers, the `receive` transaction will be a child of the corresponding `send` span.
** _Polling returns a message batch:_ typically, in such cases the agent will wrap the message collection and rely on the actual
iteration to create a transaction per message as the child of the corresponding `send` span and as part of the same trace. If iteration
occurs while there is already an active span, then the agent will add a link__*__ for each message `send` span to the active (parent)
span instead of creating transaction/span per message.

_*_ Span links are supported by APM Server and Kibana since version 8.3 and by the Java agent since version 1.32.0

[float]
==== RabbitMQ Specifics

- `context.message.queue.name` field will contain queue name when using polling, exchange name otherwise.
- `context.message.destination.resource` field will contain `rabbitmq/XXX` where `XXX` is exchange name.

Some exchange/queue names are normalized in order to keep low cardinality and user-friendlyness
- default exchange is indicated with `<default>`.
- `null` exchange is normalized to `<unknown>`, for example when polling without a message.
- generated queues whose name start with `amq.gen-` are normalized to `amq.gen-*`.
