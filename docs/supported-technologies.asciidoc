[[supported-technologies-details]]
== Supported technologies
The Elastic APM Java agent automatically instruments various APIs,
frameworks and application servers.
This section lists all supported technologies.

If your favorite technology is not supported yet,
you can vote for it by participating in our
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd0RYiwZGrEuxykYkv9z8Hl3exx_LKCtjsqEo1OWx8BkLrOQ/viewform?usp=sf_link[survey].
We will use the results to add support for the most requested technologies.

Another option is to add a dependency to the agent's <<public-api, public API>>
in order to programmatically create custom transactions and spans.

If you want to extend the auto-instrumentation capabilities of the agent,
the https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[contributing guide] should get you started.

NOTE: If, for example,
the HTTP client library of your choice is not listed,
it means that there won't be spans for those outgoing HTTP requests.
If the web framework you are using is not supported,
the agent does not capture transactions.

[[supported-web-frameworks]]
=== Web Frameworks
|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description | Since

|Servlet API
|3+
|A transaction will be created for all incoming HTTP requests to your Servlet API-based application.
 See also <<supported-app-servers>>
|1.0.0

|Spring Web MVC
|4.x, 5.x
|If you are using Spring MVC (for example with Spring Boot),
  the transactions are named based on your controllers (`ControllerClass#controllerMethod`).
|1.0.0

|JavaServer Faces
|2.2.x, 2.3.x
|If you are using JSF, transactions are named based on the requested Facelets and spans are captured for visibility into execution and
rendering
|1.0.0

|Spring Boot
|1.5+, 2.x
|Supports embedded Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow
|1.0.0

|JAX-RS
|2.x
|The transactions are named based on your resources (`ResourceClass#resourceMethod`).
 Note that only the packages configured in <<config-application-packages>> are scanned for JAX-RS resources.
 If you don't set this option,
 all classes are scanned.
 This comes at the cost of increased startup times, however.

 Note: JAX-RS is only supported when running on a supported <<supported-app-servers, Application Server/Servlet Container>>.
|1.0.0

|JAX-WS
|
|The transactions are named based on your `@javax.jws.WebService` annotated classes and `@javax.jws.WebMethod` annotated method names (`WebServiceClass#webMethod`).
 Note that only the packages configured in <<config-application-packages>> are scanned for JAX-WS resources.
 If you don't set this option,
 all classes are scanned.
 This comes at the cost of increased startup times, however.

 Note: JAX-WS is only supported when running on a supported <<supported-app-servers, Application Server/Servlet Container>> and when using the HTTP binding.
|1.4.0

|===


[float]
[[supported-app-servers]]
=== Application Servers/Servlet Containers
The Elastic APM Java agent has generic support for the Servlet API 3+.
However, some servers require special handling.
The servers listed here are tested by an integration test suite to make sure Elastic APM is compatible with them.
Other Servlet 3+ compliant servers will most likely work as well.

|===

|7.x, 8.5.x, 9.x

|<<setup-jboss-wildfly,WildFly>>
|8-16

[float]
[[supported-databases]]
=== Data Stores
|===
|Database |Supported versions | Description | Since

|JDBC
|4.1+
|The agent automatically creates DB spans for all your JDBC queries.
 This includes JDBC queries executed by O/R mappers like Hibernate.

 *Note:* Make sure that your JDBC driver is at least compiled for Java 1.5.
 For example, commons dbcp versions before 1.4 are not supported.
 IBM DB2 db2jcc drivers are also not supported.
 Please update to db2jcc4.
|1.0.0

|Elasticsearch
|5.0.2+
|The agent automatically creates Elasticsearch spans for queries done through the official REST client.
|1.0.0, async queries since 1.5.0

|Hibernate Search
|5.x (on by default), 6.x (off by default)
|The agent automatically creates Hibernate Search spans for queries done through the Hibernate Search API.

 *Note:* this feature is marked as incubating for version 6.x, which means it is off by default. In order to enable,
 set the <<config-disable-instrumentations>> config option to an empty string
|1.9.0

|Redis Jedis
|1.4.0-3.x
|The agent creates spans for interactions with the Jedis client.
|1.10.0

|===

[float]
[[supported-networking-frameworks]]
=== Networking frameworks
Distributed tracing will only work if you are using one of the supported networking frameworks.

For the supported HTTP libraries, the agent automatically creates spans for outgoing HTTP requests and propagates tracing headers.
The spans are named after the schema `<method> <host>`, for example `GET elastic.co`.

|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Note | Since

|Apache HttpClient
|4.3+

|JAX-WS client
|
|JAX-WS clients created via link:https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/xml/ws/Service.html[`javax.xml.ws.Service`]
 inherently support context propagation as they are using `HttpUrlConnection` underneath.
|1.4.0

|AsyncHttpClient
| 2.x
|
| 1.7.0

|===


[float]
[[supported-async-frameworks]]
=== Asynchronous frameworks
When a Span is created in a different Thread than its parent,
the trace context has to be propagated onto this thread.

This section lists all supported asynchronous frameworks.

|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description | Since

|ExecutorService
|
|The agent propagates the context when using the `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` methods of any `ExecutorService` implementation.
|1.4.0

|===


[float]
[[supported-messaging-frameworks]]
=== Messaging frameworks
When using a messaging framework, sender context is propagated so that receiver events are correlated to the
same trace.

|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description | Since

|JMS
|1.1, 2.0
|The agent propagates the context when using `javax.jms.MessageProducer#send` and `javax.jms.JMSProducer#send` methods
through a `Message` property. On receiver side, the agent reads the context from the Message property through
`javax.jms.MessageConsumer#receive`, `javax.jms.MessageConsumer#receiveNoWait`, `javax.jms.JMSConsumer#receive`,
`javax.jms.JMSConsumer#receiveNoWait` or `javax.jms.MessageListener#onMessage` and uses it for enabling distributed
tracing.
|1.7.0 - Incubating (off by default). In order to enable, set the <<config-disable-instrumentations>> config option to an empty string

|===


[float]
[[supported-scheduling-frameworks]]
=== Scheduling frameworks
When using a scheduling framework a transaction for every execution will be created.

|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description | Since

|Scheduling Annotation
|
|The agent instruments any method defined in a package configured in <<config-application-packages>> and annotated with one of the following:  
`org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled`  
`org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Schedules`  
`javax.ejb.Schedule`  
`javax.ejb.Schedules` in order to create a transaction with the type `scheduled`, representing the scheduled task execution
|1.6.0

|Quartz
|
|The agent instruments the `execute` method of any class implementing `org.quartz.Job`, as well as the `executeInternal` method of any class extending `org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.QuartzJobBean`, and creates a transaction with the type `scheduled`, representing the job execution 

NOTE: only classes from packages configured in <<config-application-packages>>  will be instrumented.
|1.8.0
|===

[float]
[[supported-logging-frameworks]]
=== Logging frameworks

|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description | Since

|slf4j
|1.4.1+
|When <<config-enable-log-correlation>> is set to `true`,
 the agent will add a https://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/MDC.html[MDC] entry for `trace.id` and `transaction.id`.
 See the <<config-enable-log-correlation>> configuration option for more details.

 Automatically <<api-span-capture-exception,captures exceptions>> for `logger.error("message", exception)` calls (since 1.10.0)
|1.0.0

[[supported-technologies-caveats]]
=== Caveats
* Certain OSGi containers need the following configuration setting in case you see exceptions like
  `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: co/elastic/apm/jdbc/StatementInstrumentation`:
  `org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation=co.elastic.apm.agent.*`
* Other JVM languages, like Scala, Kotlin and Groovy have not been tested yet.
* The agent does currently not support running on JVMs with an enabled `SecurityManager`.
  You may see exceptions like this: `java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.lang.RuntimePermission" "getProtectionDomain")`.
  Try to grant `java.security.AllPermission` to the agent.
