== Supported technologies
The Elastic APM Java Agent automatically instruments various APIs,
frameworks and application servers.
This section lists all supported technologies.

* <<supported-java-versions>>
* <<supported-web-frameworks>>
* <<supported-app-servers>>
* <<supported-databases>>
* <<supported-networking-frameworks>>
* <<supported-async-frameworks>>
* <<supported-messaging-frameworks>>

* <<supported-technologies-caveats>>

If your favorite technology is not supported yet,
you can vote for it by participating in our
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd0RYiwZGrEuxykYkv9z8Hl3exx_LKCtjsqEo1OWx8BkLrOQ/viewform?usp=sf_link[survey].
We will use the results to add support for the most requested technologies.

Another option is to add a dependency to the agent's <<public-api, public API>>
in order to programmatically create custom transactions and spans.

If you want to extend the auto-instrumentation capabilities of the agent,
the https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[contributing guide] should get you started.

NOTE: If, for example,
the HTTP client library of your choice is not listed,
it means that there won't be spans for those outgoing HTTP requests.
If the web framework you are using is not supported,
the agent does not capture transactions.

| 7.0.10+, 8.0.02+
|

|SAP JVM
| 8.1.065+
|
|===

NOTE: Early Java 8 versions before update 40 are *not supported* because they have
several bugs that might result in JVM crashes when a java agent is active,
thus agent *will not start* on those versions.
Similarly, Java 7 versions before update 60 are not supported as they are buggy in regard to invokedynamic.

Here is an example of the message displayed when this happens.
```
Failed to start agent - JVM version not supported: 1.8.0_31 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 25.31-b07.
To override Java version verification, set the 'elastic.apm.disable_bootstrap_checks' System property to 'true'.
```

As this message states, you can disable this check if required by adding `-Delastic.apm.disable_bootstrap_checks` to
the JVM arguments.

[[supported-web-frameworks]]
=== Web Frameworks
|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description | Since

|Servlet API
|3+
|A transaction will be created for all incoming HTTP requests to your Servlet API-based application.
 Starting in version 1.18.0, additional spans are created if the servlet dispatches execution to another servlet through the `forward` or
 `include` APIs, or to an error page.
 See also <<supported-app-servers>>
|1.0.0

|Spring Web MVC
|4.x, 5.x
|If you are using Spring MVC (for example with Spring Boot),
  the transactions are named based on your controllers (`ControllerClass#controllerMethod`).
|1.0.0

|JavaServer Faces
|2.2.x, 2.3.x
|If you are using JSF, transactions are named based on the requested Facelets and spans are captured for visibility into execution and
rendering
|1.0.0

|Spring Boot
|1.5+, 2.x
|Supports embedded Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow
|1.0.0

|JAX-RS
|2.x
|The transactions are named based on your resources (`ResourceClass#resourceMethod`).
 Note that only the packages configured in <<config-application-packages>> are scanned for JAX-RS resources.
 If you don't set this option,
 all classes are scanned.
 This comes at the cost of increased startup times, however.

 Note: JAX-RS is only supported when running on a supported <<supported-app-servers, Application Server/Servlet Container>>.
|1.0.0

|JAX-WS
|
|The transactions are named based on your `@javax.jws.WebService` annotated classes and `@javax.jws.WebMethod` annotated method names (`WebServiceClass#webMethod`).
 Note that only the packages configured in <<config-application-packages>> are scanned for JAX-WS resources.
 If you don't set this option,
 all classes are scanned.
 This comes at the cost of increased startup times, however.

 Note: JAX-WS is only supported when running on a supported <<supported-app-servers, Application Server/Servlet Container>> and when using the HTTP binding.

[float]
[[supported-app-servers]]
=== Application Servers/Servlet Containers
The Elastic APM Java agent has generic support for the Servlet API 3+.
However, some servers require special handling.
The servers listed here are tested by an integration test suite to make sure Elastic APM is compatible with them.
Other Servlet 3+ compliant servers will most likely work as well.

[float]
[[supported-async-frameworks]]
=== Asynchronous frameworks
When a Span is created in a different Thread than its parent,
the trace context has to be propagated onto this thread.

This section lists all supported asynchronous frameworks.

|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description | Since

|`ExecutorService`
|
|The agent propagates the context for `ExecutorService` s.
|1.4.0

|`ScheduledExecutorService`
|
|The agent propagates the context for `ScheduledExecutorService#schedule` (this does not include `scheduleAtFixedRate` or `scheduleWithFixedDelay`.
|1.17.0

|`ForkJoinPool`
|
|The agent propagates the context for `ForkJoinPool` s.
|1.17.0

|Scala Future
|2.13.x
|The agent propagates the context when using the `scala.concurrent.Future` or `scala.concurrent.Promise`.
It will propagate the context when using chaining methods such as `map`, `flatMap`, `traverse`, ...

NOTE: To enable Scala Future support, you need to enable experimental plugins.
|1.18.0

|===


[float]
[[supported-messaging-frameworks]]
=== Messaging frameworks
When using a messaging framework, sender context is propagated so that receiver events are correlated to the
same trace.

|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description | Since

|JMS
|1.1, 2.0
|The agent captures JMS sends and receives as spans/transactions. In addition, it propagates the context when using
`javax.jms.MessageProducer#send` and `javax.jms.JMSProducer#send` methods through a `Message` property. On receiver
side, the agent reads the context from the Message property through `javax.jms.MessageConsumer#receive`,
`javax.jms.MessageConsumer#receiveNoWait`, `javax.jms.JMSConsumer#receive`, `javax.jms.JMSConsumer#receiveNoWait` or
`javax.jms.MessageListener#onMessage` and uses it for enabling distributed tracing.
|Enabled by default since 1.13.0, added as an experimental plugin in 1.7.0

|Kafka
| <0.11.0 - without distributed tracing; 0.11.0+ - full support
|The agent captures Kafka record sends and polls. If `org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.Consumer#poll` is invoked from
within a traced transaction, a span will be created. Otherwise, the agent attempts to create a transaction for each
record read from the returned batch *as the consumer iterates over returned records.* This requires some heuristics on
the agent part, so in some cases kafka-transactions may seem missing or out of order.
If both producer and consumer are traced, then distributed tracing is supported, meaning the transaction on the consumer
side will be a part of the same trace containing the producer side as well. Kafka streams are not traced.
|1.13.0

|RabbitMQ
|3.x - 5.x
|The agent captures RabbitMQ Message sends, consumption and polling.
When the producer sends a message within a traced transaction, a send span will be created and the transaction resulting
from the message consumption will be correlated to the same trace.
When a message is consumed, a transaction is created, regardless if the send action is traced.
When a message is polled, a span is created for the polling operation and optionally have message fields if a message
has been returned.
|1.20.0

|===

For RabbitMQ:

- `context.message.queue.name` field will contain queue name when using polling, exchange name otherwise.
- `context.message.destination.resource` field will contain `rabbitmq/XXX` where `XXX` is exchange name.

Some exchange/queue names are normalized in order to keep low cardinality and user-friendlyness
- default exchange is indicated with `<default>`.
- `null` exchange is normalized to `<unknown>`, for example when polling without a message.
- generated queues whose name start with `amq.gen-` are normalized to `amq.gen-*`.

[float]
[[supported-scheduling-frameworks]]
=== Scheduling frameworks
When using a scheduling framework a transaction for every execution will be created.

|===
|Framework |Supported versions | Description | Since

|Scheduling Annotation
|
|The agent instruments any method defined in a package configured in <<config-application-packages>> and annotated with one of the following:
`org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled`
`org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Schedules`
`javax.ejb.Schedule`
`javax.ejb.Schedules` in order to create a transaction with the type `scheduled`, representing the scheduled task execution
|1.6.0

|Quartz
|2.0+
|The agent instruments the `execute` method of any class implementing `org.quartz.Job`, as well as the `executeInternal` method of any class extending `org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.QuartzJobBean`, and creates a transaction with the type `scheduled`, representing the job execution

NOTE: only classes from the quartz-jobs dependency will be instrumented automatically. For the instrumentation of other jobs the package must be added to the <<config-application-packages>> parameter.
|1.8.0

|TimerTask
|
|The agent instruments the `run` method in a package configured in <<config-application-packages>> of any class extending `java.util.TimerTask`, and creates a transaction with the type `scheduled`, representing the job execution
