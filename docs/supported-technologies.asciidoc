== Supported technologies
The Elastic APM Java agent automatically instruments various APIs,
frameworks and application servers.
This section lists all supported technologies.

If your favorite technology is not supported yet,
you can vote for it by participating in our
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd0RYiwZGrEuxykYkv9z8Hl3exx_LKCtjsqEo1OWx8BkLrOQ/viewform?usp=sf_link[survey].
We will use the results to add support for the most requested technologies.

Another option is to get involved in the development of the agent.
See the https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[contributing guide] for more details.

NOTE: If, for example,
the HTTP client library of your choice is not listed,
it means that there won't be spans for those outgoing HTTP requests.
If the web framework you are using is not supported,
the agent does not capture transactions.

[[supported-app-servers]]
=== Application Servers/Servlet Containers
The Elastic APM Java agent has generic support for the Servlet API 3+.
However, some servers require special handling.
The servers listed here are tested by an integration test suite to make sure Elastic APM is compatible with them.
Other Servlet 3+ compliant servers will most likely work as well.
