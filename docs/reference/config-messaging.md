# Messaging configuration options [config-messaging]



## `ignore_message_queues` [config-ignore-message-queues]

Used to filter out specific messaging queues/topics from being traced.

This property should be set to an array containing one or more strings. When set, sends-to and receives-from the specified queues/topic will be ignored.

This option supports the wildcard `*`, which matches zero or more characters. Examples: `/foo/*/bar/*/baz*`, `*foo*`. Matching is case insensitive by default. Prepending an element with `(?-i)` makes the matching case sensitive.

| `<none>` | List | true |

| Java System Properties | Property file | Environment |

## `jms_listener_packages` (performance [1.36.0]) [config-jms-listener-packages]

Defines which packages contain JMS MessageListener implementations for instrumentation. When empty (default), all inner-classes or any classes that have *Listener* or *Message* in their names are considered.

This configuration option helps to make MessageListener type matching faster and improve application startup performance.

Starting from version 1.43.0, the classes that are part of the *application_packages* option are also included in the list of classes considered.

## `rabbitmq_naming_mode` ([1.46.0]) [config-rabbitmq-naming-mode]

Defines whether the agent should use the exchanges, the routing key or the queue for the naming of RabbitMQ Transactions. Valid options are `QUEUE`, `ROUTING_KEY` and `EXCHANGE`. Note that `QUEUE` only works when using RabbitMQ via spring-amqp and `ROUTING_KEY` only works for the non spring-client.

[![dynamic config](images/dynamic-config.svg "") ](/reference/configuration.md#configuration-dynamic)
