# JAX-RS configuration options [config-jax-rs]



## `enable_jaxrs_annotation_inheritance` (performance) [config-enable-jaxrs-annotation-inheritance]

By default, the agent will scan for @Path annotations on the whole class hierarchy, recognizing a class as a JAX-RS resource if the class or any of its superclasses/interfaces has a class level @Path annotation. If your application does not use @Path annotation inheritance, set this property to *false* to only scan for direct @Path annotations. This can improve the startup time of the agent.

## `use_jaxrs_path_as_transaction_name` ([1.8.0]) [config-use-jaxrs-path-as-transaction-name]

By default, the agent will use `ClassName#methodName` for the transaction name of JAX-RS requests. If you want to use the URI template from the `@Path` annotation, set the value to `true`.
