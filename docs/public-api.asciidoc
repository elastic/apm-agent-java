[[public-api]]
== Public API
The public API of the Elastic APM Java agent lets you
customize and manually create spans and transactions,
as well as track errors.

The first step in getting started with the API is to declare a dependency to the API:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.elastic.apm</groupId>
    <artifactId>apm-agent-api</artifactId>
    <version>${elastic-apm.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
compile "co.elastic.apm:apm-agent-api:$elasticApmVersion"
----

Replace the version placeholders with the
link:https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:co.elastic.apm%20AND%20a:apm-agent-api[
latest version from maven central]:

[float]
[[api-tracer-api]]
=== Tracer API
The tracer gives you access to the currently active transaction and span.
It can also be used to track an exception.

To use the API, you can just invoke the static methods on the class `co.elastic.apm.api.ElasticApm`.

[float]
[[api-current-transaction]]
==== `Transaction currentTransaction()`
Returns the currently active transaction.
See <<api-transaction>> on how to customize the current transaction.

If there is no current transaction,
this method will return a noop transaction,
which means that you never have to check for `null` values.

[source,java]
----
import co.elastic.apm.api.ElasticApm;
import co.elastic.apm.api.Transaction;

Transaction transaction = ElasticApm.currentTransaction();
----

NOTE: Transactions created via <<api-start-transaction, `ElasticApm.startTransaction()`>>
can not be retrieved by calling this method.

[float]
[[api-current-span]]
==== `Span currentSpan()`
Returns the currently active span or transaction.
See <<api-span>> on how to customize the current span.

If there is no current span,
this method will return a noop span,
which means that you never have to check for `null` values.

Note that even if this method is returning a noop span,
you can still <<api-span-capture-exception,capture exceptions>> on it.
These exceptions will not have a link to a Span or a Transaction.

[source,java]
----
import co.elastic.apm.api.ElasticApm;
import co.elastic.apm.api.Span;

Span span = ElasticApm.currentSpan();
----

NOTE: Spans created via <<api-span-start-span, `createSpan()`>>
can not be retrieved by calling this method.

[float]
[[api-start-transaction]]
==== `Transaction startTransaction()`
Use this method to create a custom transaction.


Note that the agent will do this for you automatically when ever your application receives an incoming HTTP request.
You only need to use this method to create custom transactions.

It is important to call <<api-transaction-end>> when the transaction has ended.
A best practice is to use the transaction in a try-catch-finally block.
Example:

[source,java]
----
Transaction transaction = ElasticApm.startTransaction();
try {
    transaction.setName("MyController#myAction");
    transaction.setType(Transaction.TYPE_REQUEST);
    // do your thing...
} catch (Exception e) {
    transaction.captureException(e);
    throw e;
} finally {
    transaction.end();
}
----

NOTE: Spans created via this method can not be retrieved by calling <<api-current-span, `ElasticApm.currentSpan()`>>
or <<api-current-transaction, `ElasticApm.currentTransaction()`>>.

//----------------------------
[float]
[[api-transaction]]
=== Transaction API
//----------------------------
A transaction is the data captured by an agent representing an event occurring in a monitored service
and groups multiple spans in a logical group.
A transaction is the first <<api-span,`Span`>> of a service, and is also known under the term entry span.

See <<api-current-transaction>> on how to get a reference of the current transaction.

`Transaction` is a sub-type of `Span`.
So it has all the methods a <<api-span,`Span`>> offers plus additional ones.

[float]
[[api-set-name]]
==== `void setName(String name)`
Override the name of the current transaction.
For supported frameworks,
the transaction name is determined automatically,
and can be overridden using this method.

Example:

[source,java]
----
transaction.setName("My Transaction");
----


* `name`: (required) A string describing name of the transaction

[float]
[[api-transaction-set-type]]
==== `void setType(String type)`
Sets the type of the transaction.
Thereâ€™s a special type called `request`,
which is used by the agent for the transactions automatically created when an incoming HTTP request is detected.

Example:

[source,java]
----
transaction.setType(Transaction.TYPE_REQUEST);
----

* `type`: The type of the transaction

[float]
[[api-transaction-add-tag]]
==== `void addTag(String key, String value)`
A flat mapping of user-defined tags with string values.
Note: the tags are indexed in Elasticsearch so that they are searchable and aggregatable.
By all means,
you should avoid that user specified data,
like URL parameters,
is used as a tag key as it can lead to mapping explosions.

[source,java]
----
transaction.setTag("foo", "bar");
----

* `key`:   The tag key
* `value`: The tag value

[float]
[[api-transaction-set-user]]
==== `void setUser(String id, String email, String username)`
Call this to enrich collected performance data and errors with information about the user/client.
This method can be called at any point during the request/response life cycle (i.e. while a transaction is active).
The given context will be added to the active transaction.

If an error is captured, the context from the active transaction is used as context for the captured error.

[source,java]
----
transaction.setUser(user.getId(), user.getEmail(), user.getUsername());
----


* `id`:       The user's id or `null`, if not applicable.
* `email`:    The user's email address or `null`, if not applicable.
* `username`: The user's name or `null`, if not applicable.


[float]
[[api-transaction-capture-exception]]
==== `void captureException(Exception e)`
Captures an exception and reports it to the APM server.

[float]
[[api-transaction-get-id]]
==== `String getId()`
Returns the id of this transaction (never `null`)

If this transaction represents a noop,
this method returns an empty string.

[float]
[[api-transaction-start-span]]
==== `Span createSpan()`
Start and return a new custom span as a child of this transaction.

It is important to call <<api-span-end>> when the span has ended.
A best practice is to use the span in a try-catch-finally block.
Example:

[source,java]
----
Span span = parent.createSpan();
try {
    span.setName("SELECT FROM customer");
    span.setType("db.mysql.query");
    // do your thing...
} catch (Exception e) {
    ElasticApm.captureException(e);
    throw e;
} finally {
    span.end();
}
----

NOTE: Spans created via this method can not be retrieved by calling <<api-current-span, `ElasticApm.currentSpan()`>>.

[float]
[[api-transaction-end]]
==== `void end()`
End tracking the transaction.
Should be called e.g. at the end of a request or when ending a background task.
Example:

[source,java]
----
transaction.end();
----


//----------------------------
[float]
[[api-span]]
=== Span API
//----------------------------
A span contains information about a specific code path, executed as part of a transaction.

If for example a database query happens within a recorded transaction,
a span representing this database query may be created.
In such a case the name of the span will contain information about the query itself,
and the type will hold information about the database type.

See <<api-current-span>> on how to get a reference of the current span.

[float]
[[api-span-set-name]]
==== `void setName(String name)`
Override the name of the current span.

Example:

[source,java]
----
span.setName("SELECT FROM customer");
----

* `name`: the name of the span

[float]
[[api-span-set-type]]
==== `void setType(String type)`
Sets the type of span.
The type is a hierarchical string used to group similar spans together.
For instance, all spans of MySQL queries are given the type `db.mysql.query`.


In the above example `db` is considered the type prefix. Though there are no naming restrictions for this prefix,
the following are standardized across all Elastic APM agents: `app`, `db`, `cache`, `template`, and `ext`.

* `type`: the type of the span

[float]
[[api-span-add-tag]]
==== `void addTag(String key, String value)`
A flat mapping of user-defined tags with string values.
Note: the tags are indexed in Elasticsearch so that they are searchable and aggregatable.
By all means,
you should avoid that user specified data,
like URL parameters,
is used as a tag key as it can lead to mapping explosions.

[source,java]
----
span.setTag("foo", "bar");
----

* `key`:   The tag key
* `value`: The tag value

[float]
[[api-span-capture-exception]]
==== `void captureException(Exception e)`
Captures an exception and reports it to the APM server.

[float]
[[api-span-get-id]]
==== `String getId()`
Returns the id of this span (never `null`)

If this span represents a noop,
this method returns an empty string.

[float]
[[api-span-end]]
==== `void end()`
Ends the span.
If the span has already ended, nothing happens.


[float]
[[api-span-start-span]]
==== `Span createSpan()`
Start and return a new custom span as a child of this span.

It is important to call <<api-span-end>> when the span has ended.
A best practice is to use the span in a try-catch-finally block.
Example:

[source,java]
----
Span span = parent.createSpan();
try {
    span.setName("SELECT FROM customer");
    span.setType("db.mysql.query");
    // do your thing...
} catch (Exception e) {
    span.captureException(e);
    throw e;
} finally {
    span.end();
}
----

NOTE: Spans created via this method can not be retrieved by calling <<api-current-span, `ElasticApm.currentSpan()`>>.
