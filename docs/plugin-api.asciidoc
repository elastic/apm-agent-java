== Plugin API
The plugin API of the Elastic APM Java agent lets you add custom instrumentation to the agent, which
the agent will automatically apply the same way as it applies the internally defined instrumentation.

The plugin API is the OpenTelemetry API, plus a dependency to the Plugin SDK (apm-agent-plugin-sdk),
and requires a version 1.31.0+ agent.

An https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java-plugin-example[example repo] and an
https://www.elastic.co/blog/create-your-own-instrumentation-with-the-java-agent-plugin[article]
provide a detailed example of adding custom instrumentation for an application to the agent. An overview is

1. subclass `co.elastic.apm.agent.sdk.ElasticApmInstrumentation`
2. specify matchers the define which classes and methods will be instrumented
3. add an instrumentation advice implementation
4. create a `META-INF/services/co.elastic.apm.agent.sdk.ElasticApmInstrumentation` file which lists the
fully qualified instrumentation class names, one class name per line
5. create a plugin jar that includes the instrumentation classes, the `co.elastic.apm.agent.sdk.ElasticApmInstrumentation`
file, and any dependencies (apart from the agent itself, though including the plugin API as shown above)
6. start your application with the agent as normal, but additionally with the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/java/current/config-core.html#config-plugins-dir[plugins_dir configuration option]
set to a directory which includes the created plugin jar (and which should only hold plugin jars, as the agent will attempt
to load any jar in that directory).
