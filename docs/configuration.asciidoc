== Configuration
To adapt the Elastic APM agent to your needs,
you can configure it using different configuration sources,
which have different naming conventions for the property key.
The first configuration sources override the configuration values of over the latter sources.

[arabic]
. Java system properties +
  All configuration keys are prefixed with `elastic.apm.`
. Environment variables +
  All configuration keys are in uppercase and prefixed with `ELASTIC_APM_`
. `elasticapm.properties` file +
  You can place a `elasticapm.properties` in the same directory the agent jar resides in.
  No prefix is required for the configuration keys.

Configuration options marked with Dynamic true can be changed at runtime
via configuration sources which support dynamic reloading.
Java system properties can be set from within the application.

In order to get started with Elastic APM,
the most important configuration options are <<config-service-name>>,
<<config-server-urls>> and <<config-application-packages>>.
So a minimal version of a configuration might look like this:

[source,bash]
.System properties
----
-Delastic.apm.service_name=my-cool-service
-Delastic.apm.application_packages=org.example,org.another.example
-Delastic.apm.server_urls=http://localhost:8200
----

[source,properties]
.elasticapm.properties
----
service_name=my-cool-service
application_packages=org.example,org.another.example
server_urls=http://localhost:8200
----

[source,bash]
.Environment variables
----
ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME=my-cool-service
ELASTIC_APM_APPLICATION_PACKAGES=org.example,org.another.example
ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URLS=http://localhost:8200

[[config-core]]
=== Core configuration options
[float]
[[config-active]]
==== `active`

A boolean specifying if the agent should be active or not. If active, the agent will instrument incoming HTTP requests and track errors.

You can use this setting to dynamically disable Elastic APM at runtime.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic
| `true` | Boolean | true
|============


[options="header"]
|============
| Java System Properties      | Property file   | Environment
| `elastic.apm.active` | `active` | `ELASTIC_APM_ACTIVE`
|============

[float]
[[config-instrument]]
==== `instrument`

A boolean specifying if the agent should instrument the application to collect performance metrics for the app. When set to false, Elastic APM will not affect your application at all.

NOTE: Both active and instrument needs to be true for instrumentation to be running.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic
| `true` | Boolean | false
|============


[options="header"]

| Java System Properties      | Property file   | Environment
| `elastic.apm.instrument` | `instrument` | `ELASTIC_APM_INSTRUMENT`
|============

[float]
[[config-service-name]]
==== `service_name`

This is used to keep all the errors and transactions of your service together
and is the primary filter in the Elastic APM user interface.

The service name must conform to this regular expression: `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$`.
In less regexy terms:
Your service name must only contain characters from the ASCII alphabet, numbers, dashes, underscores and spaces.

NOTE: When relying on auto-discovery of the service name in Servlet environments (including Spring Boot),
there is currently a caveat related to metrics.
The consequence is that the 'Metrics' tab of a service does not show process-global metrics like CPU utilization.
The reason is that metrics are reported with the detected default service name for the JVM,
for example `tomcat-application`.
That is because there may be multiple web applications deployed to a single JVM/servlet container.
However, you can view those metrics by selecting the `tomcat-application` service name, for example.
Future versions of the Elastic APM stack will have better support for that scenario.
A workaround is to explicitly set the `service_name` which means all applications deployed to the same servlet container will have the same name
or to disable the corresponding `*-service-name` detecting instrumentations via <<config-disable-instrumentations>>.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic
| For Spring-based application, uses the `spring.application.name` property, if set.
For Servlet-based applications, uses the `display-name` of the `web.xml`, if available.
Falls back to the servlet context path the application is mapped to (unless mapped to the root context).
Note: the above service name auto discovery mechanisms require APM Server 7.0+.
Falls back to the name of the main class or jar file.
If the service name is set explicitly, it overrides all of the above.
 | String | false

|============

[float]
[[config-service-version]]
==== `service_version`

A version string for the currently deployed version of the service. If you donâ€™t version your deployments, the recommended value for this field is the commit identifier of the deployed revision, e.g. the output of git rev-parse HEAD.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

[float]
[[config-environment]]
==== `environment`

The name of the environment this service is deployed in, e.g. "production" or "staging".

NOTE: The APM UI does not fully support the environment setting yet.
You can use the query bar to filter for a specific environment,
but by default the environments will be mixed together.
Also keep that in mind when creating alerts.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

| Java System Properties      | Property file   | Environment
| `elastic.apm.environment` | `environment` | `ELASTIC_APM_ENVIRONMENT`
|============

[float]
[[config-transaction-sample-rate]]
==== `transaction_sample_rate` (performance)

By default, the agent will sample every transaction (e.g. request to your service). To reduce overhead and storage requirements, you can set the sample rate to a value between 0.0 and 1.0. We still record overall time and the result for unsampled transactions, but no context information, labels, or spans.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic
| `1.0` | Double | true

| `elastic.apm.transaction_sample_rate` | `transaction_sample_rate` | `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_SAMPLE_RATE`
|============

[float]
[[config-transaction-max-spans]]
==== `transaction_max_spans` (performance)

Limits the amount of spans that are recorded per transaction.

This is helpful in cases where a transaction creates a very high amount of spans (e.g. thousands of SQL queries).

Setting an upper limit will prevent overloading the agent and the APM server with too much work for such edge cases.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic
| `500` | Integer | true
|============


[options="header"]
|============
| Java System Properties      | Property file   | Environment
| `elastic.apm.transaction_max_spans` | `transaction_max_spans` | `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_MAX_SPANS`
|============

[float]
[[config-sanitize-field-names]]
==== `sanitize_field_names` (security)

Sometimes it is necessary to sanitize the data sent to Elastic APM,
e.g. remove sensitive data.

Configure a list of wildcard patterns of field names which should be sanitized.
These apply for example to HTTP headers and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data.

This option supports the wildcard `*`, which matches zero or more characters.
Examples: `/foo/*/bar/*/baz*`, `*foo*`.
Matching is case insensitive by default.
Prepending an element with `(?-i)` makes the matching case sensitive.

NOTE: Data in the query string is considered non-sensitive,
as sensitive information should not be sent in the query string.
See https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Information_exposure_through_query_strings_in_url for more information

NOTE: Review the data captured by Elastic APM carefully to make sure it does not capture sensitive information.
If you do find sensitive data in the Elasticsearch index,
you should add an additional entry to this list (make sure to also include the default entries).


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic
| `password, passwd, pwd, secret, *key, *token*, *session*, *credit*, *card*, authorization, set-cookie` | List | true

|============

[float]
[[config-disable-instrumentations]]
==== `disable_instrumentations`

A list of instrumentations which should be disabled.
Valid options are `annotations`, `apache-httpclient`, `concurrent`, `dispatcher-servlet`, `elasticsearch-restclient`, `executor`, `http-client`, `incubating`, `jax-rs`, `jax-ws`, `jdbc`, `jsf`, `okhttp`, `opentracing`, `public-api`, `render`, `scheduled`, `servlet-api`, `servlet-api-async`, `servlet-input-stream`, `servlet-service-name`, `spring-mvc`, `spring-resttemplate`, `spring-service-name`, `urlconnection`.
If you want to try out incubating features,
set the value to an empty string.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic
| `incubating` | Collection | false
|============


[options="header"]
|============
| Java System Properties      | Property file   | Environment
| `elastic.apm.disable_instrumentations` | `disable_instrumentations` | `ELASTIC_APM_DISABLE_INSTRUMENTATIONS`
|============

[float]
[[config-unnest-exceptions]]
==== `unnest_exceptions`

When reporting exceptions,
un-nests the exceptions matching the wildcard pattern.
This can come in handy for Spring's `org.springframework.web.util.NestedServletException`,
for example.

This option supports the wildcard `*`, which matches zero or more characters.
Examples: `/foo/*/bar/*/baz*`, `*foo*`.
Matching is case insensitive by default.
Prepending an element with `(?-i)` makes the matching case sensitive.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic
| `(?-i)*Nested*Exception` | List | true
|============


[options="header"]
|============
| Java System Properties      | Property file   | Environment
| `elastic.apm.unnest_exceptions` | `unnest_exceptions` | `ELASTIC_APM_UNNEST_EXCEPTIONS`
|============

[float]
[[config-trace-methods]]
==== `trace_methods` (added[1.3.0,Enhancements in 1.4.0])

A list of methods for with to create a transaction or span.

The syntax is `modifier fully.qualified.class.Name#methodName(fully.qualified.parameter.Type)`.
You can use wildcards for the class name, the method name and the parameter types.
The `*` wildcard matches zero or more characters.
That means that a wildcard in a package name also matches sub-packages
Specifying the parameter types is optional.
The `modifier` can be omitted or one of `public`, `protected`, `private` or `*`.

A few examples:

 - `org.example.*` added[1.4.0,Omitting the method is possible since 1.4.0]
 - `org.example.*#*` (before 1.4.0, you need to specify a method matcher)
 - `org.example.MyClass#myMethod`
 - `org.example.MyClass#myMethod()`
 - `org.example.MyClass#myMethod(java.lang.String)`
 - `org.example.MyClass#myMe*od(java.lang.String, int)`
 - `private org.example.MyClass#myMe*od(java.lang.String, *)`
 - `* org.example.MyClas*#myMe*od(*.String, int[])`
 - `public org.example.services.*Service#*`

NOTE: Only use wildcards if necessary.
The more methods you match the more overhead will be caused by the agent.
Also note that there is a maximum amount of spans per transaction (see <<config-transaction-max-spans, `transaction_max_spans`>>).

NOTE: The agent will create stack traces for spans which took longer than
<<config-span-frames-min-duration, `span_frames_min_duration`>>.
When tracing a large number of methods (for example by using wildcards),
this may lead to high overhead.
Consider increasing the threshold or disabling stack trace collection altogether.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic
| `<none>` | List | false
|============


[options="header"]

| `elastic.apm.trace_methods` | `trace_methods` | `ELASTIC_APM_TRACE_METHODS`
|============

[[config-http]]
=== HTTP configuration options
[float]
[[config-capture-body]]
==== `capture_body` (performance)

For transactions that are HTTP requests, the Java agent can optionally capture the request body (e.g. POST variables).

If the request has a body and this setting is disabled, the body will be shown as [REDACTED].

This option is case-insensitive.

NOTE: Currently, only UTF-8 encoded plain text content types are supported.
The option <<config-capture-body-content-types>> determines which content types are captured.

WARNING: Request bodies often contain sensitive values like passwords, credit card numbers etc.
If your service handles data like this, we advise to only enable this feature with care.
Turning on body capturing can also significantly increase the overhead in terms of heap usage,
network utilisation and Elasticsearch index size.

Valid options: `off`, `errors`, `transactions`, `all`

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic
| `OFF` | EventType | true

|============

[float]
[[config-capture-body-content-types]]
==== `capture_body_content_types` (added[1.5.0] performance)

Configures which content types should be recorded.

The defaults end with a wildcard so that content types like `text/plain; charset=utf-8` are captured as well.

This option supports the wildcard `*`, which matches zero or more characters.
Examples: `/foo/*/bar/*/baz*`, `*foo*`.
Matching is case insensitive by default.
Prepending an element with `(?-i)` makes the matching case sensitive.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

|============

[float]
[[config-capture-headers]]
==== `capture_headers` (performance)

If set to `true`,
the agent will capture request and response headers, including cookies.

NOTE: Setting this to `false` reduces network bandwidth, disk space and object allocations.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

[float]
[[config-ignore-urls]]
==== `ignore_urls`

Used to restrict requests to certain URLs from being instrumented.

This property should be set to an array containing one or more strings.
When an incoming HTTP request is detected, its URL will be tested against each element in this list.

This option supports the wildcard `*`, which matches zero or more characters.
Examples: `/foo/*/bar/*/baz*`, `*foo*`.
Matching is case insensitive by default.
Prepending an element with `(?-i)` makes the matching case sensitive.

NOTE: All errors that are captured during a request to an ignored URL are still sent to the APM Server regardless of this setting.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

==== `ignore_user_agents`

Used to restrict requests from certain User-Agents from being instrumented.

When an incoming HTTP request is detected,
the User-Agent from the request headers will be tested against each element in this list.
Example: `curl/*`, `*pingdom*`

This option supports the wildcard `*`, which matches zero or more characters.
Examples: `/foo/*/bar/*/baz*`, `*foo*`.
Matching is case insensitive by default.
Prepending an element with `(?-i)` makes the matching case sensitive.

NOTE: All errors that are captured during a request by an ignored user agent are still sent to the APM Server regardless of this setting.

[float]
[[config-use-path-as-transaction-name]]
==== `use_path_as_transaction_name` (experimental)

If set to `true`,
transaction names of unsupported Servlet API-based frameworks will be in the form of `$method $path` instead of just `$method`.

WARNING: If your URLs contain path parameters like `/user/$userId`,
you should be very careful when enabling this flag,
as it can lead to an explosion of transaction groups.
Take a look at the `url_groups` option on how to mitigate this problem by grouping URLs together.

[[config-url-groups]]
==== `url_groups`

This option is only considered, when `use_path_as_transaction_name` is active.

With this option, you can group several URL paths together by using a wildcard expression like `/user/*`.

This option supports the wildcard `*`, which matches zero or more characters.
Examples: `/foo/*/bar/*/baz*`, `*foo*`.
Matching is case insensitive by default.
Prepending an element with `(?-i)` makes the matching case sensitive.

[[config-jax-rs]]
=== JAX-RS configuration options
[float]
[[config-enable-jaxrs-annotation-inheritance]]
==== `enable_jaxrs_annotation_inheritance` (performance)

By default, the agent will scan for @Path annotations on the whole class hierarchy, recognizing a class as a JAX-RS resource if the class or any of its superclasses/interfaces has a class level @Path annotation.
If your application does not use @Path annotation inheritance, set this property to 'false' to only scan for direct @Path annotations. This can improve the startup time of the agent.

[[config-enable-log-correlation]]
==== `enable_log_correlation`

A boolean specifying if the agent should integrate into SLF4J's MDC to enable trace-log correlation.
If set to `true`, the agent will set the `spanId` and `traceId` for the currently active spans and transactions to the MDC.
You can then use the pattern format of your logging implementation to write the MDC values to your log file.
With the help of Filebeat and Logstash or an Elasticsearch ingest pipeline,
you can index your log files and correlate them with APM traces.
With this integration you can get all logs belonging to a particular trace and vice-versa:
for a specific log, see in which context it has been logged and which parameters the user provided. 
While it's allowed to enable this setting at runtime, you can't disable it without a restart.

NOTE: This is an incubating feature and the MDC key names might change.

[[config-server-timeout]]
==== `server_timeout`

If a request to the APM server takes longer than the configured timeout,
the request is cancelled and the event (exception or transaction) is discarded.
Set to 0 to disable timeouts.

WARNING: If timeouts are disabled or set to a high value, your app could experience memory issues if the APM server times out.

Supports the duration suffixes `ms`, `s` and `m`.
Example: `5s`.
The default unit for this option is `s`

[[config-max-queue-size]]
==== `max_queue_size`

The maximum size of buffered events.

Events like transactions and spans are buffered when the agent can't keep up with sending them to the APM Server or if the APM server is down.

If the queue is full, events are rejected which means you will lose transactions and spans in that case.
This guards the application from crashing in case the APM server is unavailable for a longer period of time.

A lower value will decrease the heap overhead of the agent,
while a higher value makes it less likely to lose events in case of a temporary spike in throughput.

If the name of a metric matches any of the wildcard expressions, it will not be collected.
Example: `foo.*,bar.*`

This option supports the wildcard `*`, which matches zero or more characters.
Examples: `/foo/*/bar/*/baz*`, `*foo*`.
Matching is case insensitive by default.
Prepending an element with `(?-i)` makes the matching case sensitive.

[[config-span-frames-min-duration]]
==== `span_frames_min_duration` (performance)

In its default settings, the APM agent will collect a stack trace with every recorded span.
While this is very helpful to find the exact place in your code that causes the span, collecting this stack trace does have some overhead. 
When setting this option to a negative value, like `-1ms`, stack traces will be collected for all spans. Setting it to a positive value, e.g. `5ms`, will limit stack trace collection to spans with durations equal or longer than the given value, e.g. 5 milliseconds.

To disable stack trace collection for spans completely, set the value to `0ms`.

Supports the duration suffixes `ms`, `s` and `m`.
Example: `5ms`.
The default unit for this option is `ms`

# You can use this setting to dynamically disable Elastic APM at runtime.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Boolean
# Default value: true
#
# active=true

# A boolean specifying if the agent should instrument the application to collect performance metrics for the app. When set to false, Elastic APM will not affect your application at all.
# 
# NOTE: Both active and instrument needs to be true for instrumentation to be running.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: Boolean
# Default value: true
#
# instrument=true

# The name of your service
#
# This is used to keep all the errors and transactions of your service together
# and is the primary filter in the Elastic APM user interface.
# 
# The service name must conform to this regular expression: `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$`.
# In less regexy terms:
# Your service name must only contain characters from the ASCII alphabet, numbers, dashes, underscores and spaces.
# 
# NOTE: When relying on auto-discovery of the service name in Servlet environments (including Spring Boot),
# there is currently a caveat related to metrics.
# The consequence is that the 'Metrics' tab of a service does not show process-global metrics like CPU utilization.
# The reason is that metrics are reported with the detected default service name for the JVM,
# for example `tomcat-application`.
# That is because there may be multiple web applications deployed to a single JVM/servlet container.
# However, you can view those metrics by selecting the `tomcat-application` service name, for example.
# Future versions of the Elastic APM stack will have better support for that scenario.
# A workaround is to explicitly set the `service_name` which means all applications deployed to the same servlet container will have the same name
# or to disable the corresponding `*-service-name` detecting instrumentations via <<config-disable-instrumentations>>.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: String
# Default value: For Spring-based application, uses the `spring.application.name` property, if set.

Falls back to the servlet context path the application is mapped to (unless mapped to the root context).
Note: the above service name auto discovery mechanisms require APM Server 7.0+.
Falls back to the name of the main class or jar file.

# A list of methods for with to create a transaction or span.
# 
# The syntax is `modifier fully.qualified.class.Name#methodName(fully.qualified.parameter.Type)`.
# You can use wildcards for the class name, the method name and the parameter types.
# The `*` wildcard matches zero or more characters.
# That means that a wildcard in a package name also matches sub-packages
# Specifying the parameter types is optional.
# The `modifier` can be omitted or one of `public`, `protected`, `private` or `*`.
# 
# A few examples:
# 
#  - `org.example.*` added[1.4.0,Omitting the method is possible since 1.4.0]

#
# If a request to the APM server takes longer than the configured timeout,
# the request is cancelled and the event (exception or transaction) is discarded.
# Set to 0 to disable timeouts.
# 
# WARNING: If timeouts are disabled or set to a high value, your app could experience memory issues if the APM server times out.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: TimeDuration
# Supports the duration suffixes ms, s and m. Example: 5s.
# The default unit for this option is s.
# Default value: 5s
#
# server_timeout=5s

# By default, the agent verifies the SSL certificate if you use an HTTPS connection to the APM server.
# 
# Verification can be disabled by changing this setting to false.

# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: Boolean
# Default value: true

# verify_server_cert=true

# Interval with which transactions should be sent to the APM server.
# 
# A lower value will increase the load on your APM server,
# while a higher value can increase the memory pressure on your app.
# 
# A higher value also impacts the time until transactions are indexed and searchable in Elasticsearch.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: TimeDuration
# Supports the duration suffixes ms, s and m. Example: 1s.
# The default unit for this option is s.
# Default value: 1s
#
# flush_interval=1s

# The maximum size of buffered events.
# 
# Events like transactions and spans are buffered when the agent can't keep up with sending them to the APM Server or if the APM server is down.
# 
# If the queue is full, events are rejected which means you will lose transactions and spans in that case.
# This guards the application from crashing in case the APM server is unavailable for a longer period of time.
# 
# A lower value will decrease the heap overhead of the agent,
# while a higher value makes it less likely to lose events in case of a temporary spike in throughput.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Integer
# Default value: 512

# max_queue_size=512

# Whether each transaction should have the process arguments attached.
# Disabled by default to save disk space.

# Maximum time to keep an HTTP request to the APM Server open for.
# 
# NOTE: This value has to be lower than the APM Server's `read_timeout` setting.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: TimeDuration
# Supports the duration suffixes ms, s and m. Example: 10s.
# The default unit for this option is s.
# Default value: 10s
#
# api_request_time=10s

# The maximum total compressed size of the request body which is sent to the APM server intake api via a chunked encoding (HTTP streaming).
# Note that a small overshoot is possible.
# 
# Allowed byte units are `b`, `kb` and `mb`. `1kb` is equal to `1024b`.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: ByteValue
# Default value: 768kb
#
# api_request_size=768kb

# The interval at which the agent sends metrics to the APM Server.
# Must be at least `1s`.
# Set to `0s` to deactivate.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: TimeDuration
# Supports the duration suffixes ms, s and m. Example: 30s.
# The default unit for this option is s.
# Default value: 30s
#
# metrics_interval=30s

# Disables the collection of certain metrics.
# If the name of a metric matches any of the wildcard expressions, it will not be collected.
# Example: `foo.*,bar.*`
# 
# This option supports the wildcard `*`, which matches zero or more characters.
# Examples: `/foo/*/bar/*/baz*`, `*foo*`.
# Matching is case insensitive by default.
# Prepending an element with `(?-i)` makes the matching case sensitive.

# Used to determine whether a stack trace frame is an 'in-app frame' or a 'library frame'.
# Multiple packages can be set as a comma-separated list.
# Setting this option can also improve the startup time.
# 
# In order to be able to use the API annotations @CaptureTransaction and @CaptureSpan,
# it is required to set these options.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: comma separated list
# Default value: 
#
# application_packages=

# Setting it to 0 will disable stack trace collection. Any positive integer value will be used as the maximum number of frames to collect. Setting it -1 means that all frames will be collected.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Integer
# Default value: 50
#
# stack_trace_limit=50

# In its default settings, the APM agent will collect a stack trace with every recorded span.
# While this is very helpful to find the exact place in your code that causes the span, collecting this stack trace does have some overhead. 
# When setting this option to a negative value, like `-1ms`, stack traces will be collected for all spans. Setting it to a positive value, e.g. `5ms`, will limit stack trace collection to spans with durations equal or longer than the given value, e.g. 5 milliseconds.
# 
# To disable stack trace collection for spans completely, set the value to `0ms`.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: TimeDuration
# Supports the duration suffixes ms, s and m. Example: 5ms.
# The default unit for this option is ms.
# Default value: 5ms
#
