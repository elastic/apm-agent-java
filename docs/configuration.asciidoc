[[configuration]]
== Configuration
To adapt the Elastic APM agent to your needs,
you can configure it using different configuration sources,
which have different naming conventions for the property key.
The first configuration sources override the configuration values of over the latter sources.

[arabic]
. Java system properties +
  All configuration keys are prefixed with `elastic.apm.`
. Environment variables +
  All configuration keys are in uppercase and prefixed with `ELASTIC_APM_`
. `elasticapm.properties` file +
  You can place a `elasticapm.properties` in the same directory the agent jar resides in.
  No prefix is required for the configuration keys.

Configuration options marked with Dynamic true can be changed at runtime
via configuration sources which support dynamic reloading.
Java system properties can be set from within the application.

In order to get started with Elastic APM,
the most important configuration options are <<config-service-name>> (required),
<<config-server-url>> and <<config-application-packages>>.
So a minimal version of a configuration might look like this:

[source,bash]
.System properties
----
-Delastic.apm.service_name=my-cool-service
-Delastic.apm.application_packages=org.example
-Delastic.apm.server_url=http://localhost:8300
----

[source,properties]
.elasticapm.properties
----
service_name=my-cool-service
application_packages=org.example
server_url=http://localhost:8300
----

[source,bash]
.Environment variables
----
ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME=my-cool-service
ELASTIC_APM_APPLICATION_PACKAGES=org.example
ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8300

[[config-core]]
=== Core configuration options
[float]
[[config-active]]
==== `active`

A boolean specifying if the agent should be active or not. If active, the agent will instrument incoming HTTP requests and track errors.

You can use this setting to dynamically disable Elastic APM at runtime.

|============

[float]
[[config-service-name]]
==== `service_name`

This is used to keep all the errors and transactions of your service together
and is the primary filter in the Elastic APM user interface.

NOTE: The service name must conform to this regular expression: ^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$. In less regexy terms: Your service name must only contain characters from the ASCII alphabet, numbers, dashes, underscores and spaces.


[options="header"]
|============

|============

[float]
[[config-service-version]]
==== `service_version`

A version string for the currently deployed version of the service. If you donâ€™t version your deployments, the recommended value for this field is the commit identifier of the deployed revision, e.g. the output of git rev-parse HEAD.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

[float]
[[config-transaction-sample-rate]]
==== `transaction_sample_rate`

By default, the agent will sample every transaction (e.g. request to your service). To reduce overhead and storage requirements, you can set the sample rate to a value between 0.0 and 1.0. We still record overall time and the result for unsampled transactions, but no context information, tags, or spans.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

|============

[float]
[[config-transaction-max-spans]]
==== `transaction_max_spans`

Limits the amount of spans that are recorded per transaction.

This is helpful in cases where a transaction creates a very high amount of spans (e.g. thousands of SQL queries).

Setting an upper limit will prevent overloading the agent and the APM server with too much work for such edge cases.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

|============

[float]
[[config-sanitize-field-names]]
==== `sanitize_field_names`

Sometimes it is necessary to sanitize the data sent to Elastic APM,
e.g. remove sensitive data.

Configure a list of wildcard patterns of field names which should be sanitized.
These apply for example to HTTP headers and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data.


NOTE: A wildcard expression may either contain a single wildcard in the middle or have wildcards at the beginning and/or the end. Legal: `*foo*`, `foo*`, `*foo`, `foo*bar*`. Illegal: `foo*bar*`, `foo*bar*baz`.
Prepending an element with `(?i)` makes the matching case-insensitive.

NOTE: Data in the query string is considered non-sensitive,
as sensitive information should not be sent in the query string.
See https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Information_exposure_through_query_strings_in_url for more information

NOTE: Review the data captured by Elastic APM carefully to make sure it does not capture sensitive information.
If you do find sensitive data in the Elasticsearch index,
you should add an additional entry to this list (make sure to also include the default entries).


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

[[config-http]]
=== HTTP configuration options
[float]
[[config-capture-body]]
==== `capture_body`

For transactions that are HTTP requests, the Java agent can optionally capture the request body (e.g. POST variables).

If the request has a body and this setting is disabled, the body will be shown as [REDACTED].

This option is case-insensitive.
NOTE: Currently, only `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (form parameters) are supported.
Forms which include a file upload (`multipart/form-data`) are not supported.

WARNING: request bodies often contain sensitive values like passwords, credit card numbers etc.If your service handles data like this, we advise to only enable this feature with care.

Valid options: `off`, `errors`, `transactions`, `all`

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

[float]
[[config-ignore-urls]]
==== `ignore_urls`

Used to restrict requests to certain URLs from being instrumented.

This property should be set to an array containing one or more strings.
When an incoming HTTP request is detected, its URL will be tested against each element in this list.

NOTE: A wildcard expression may either contain a single wildcard in the middle or have wildcards at the beginning and/or the end. Legal: `*foo*`, `foo*`, `*foo`, `foo*bar*`. Illegal: `foo*bar*`, `foo*bar*baz`.
Prepending an element with `(?i)` makes the matching case-insensitive.

NOTE: All errors that are captured during a request to an ignored URL are still sent to the APM Server regardless of this setting.


[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type                | Dynamic

[float]
[[config-ignore-user-agents]]
==== `ignore_user_agents`

Used to restrict requests from certain User-Agents from being instrumented.

When an incoming HTTP request is detected,
the User-Agent from the request headers will be tested against each element in this list.
Example: `curl/*, (?i)*pingdom*`

NOTE: A wildcard expression may either contain a single wildcard in the middle or have wildcards at the beginning and/or the end. Legal: `*foo*`, `foo*`, `*foo`, `foo*bar*`. Illegal: `foo*bar*`, `foo*bar*baz`.
Prepending an element with `(?i)` makes the matching case-insensitive.

NOTE: All errors that are captured during a request by an ignored user agent are still sent to the APM Server regardless of this setting.

[float]
[[config-use-path-as-transaction-name]]
==== `use_path_as_transaction_name`

If set to `true`,
transaction names of unsupported Servlet API-based frameworks will be in the form of `$method $path` instead of just `$method`.

WARNING: If your URLs contain path parameters like `/user/$userId`,
you should be very careful when enabling this flag,
as it can lead to an explosion of transaction groups.
Take a look at the `url_groups` option on how to mitigate this problem by grouping URLs together.


[options="header"]

|============

[float]
[[config-url-groups]]
==== `url_groups`

This option is only considered, when `use_path_as_transaction_name` is active.

With this option, you can group several URL paths together by using a wildcard expression like `/user/*`.

NOTE: A wildcard expression may either contain a single wildcard in the middle or have wildcards at the beginning and/or the end. Legal: `*foo*`, `foo*`, `*foo`, `foo*bar*`. Illegal: `foo*bar*`, `foo*bar*baz`.
Prepending an element with `(?i)` makes the matching case-insensitive.

[[config-max-queue-size]]
==== `max_queue_size`

Maximum queue length of transactions before sending transactions to the APM server.

A lower value will increase the load on your APM server,
while a higher value can increase the memory pressure of your app.

A higher value also impacts the time until transactions are indexed and searchable in Elasticsearch.

This setting is useful to limit memory consumption if you experience a sudden spike of traffic.

[[config-span-frames-min-duration]]
==== `span_frames_min_duration`

In its default settings, the APM agent will collect a stack trace with every recorded span.
While this is very helpful to find the exact place in your code that causes the span, collecting this stack trace does have some overhead. 
When setting this option to `-1`, stack traces will be collected for all spans. Setting it to a positive value, e.g. `5`, will limit stack trace collection to spans with durations equal or longer than the given value in milliseconds, e.g. 5 milliseconds.

To disable stack trace collection for spans completely, set the value to 0.

# For transactions that are HTTP requests, the Java agent can optionally capture the request body (e.g. POST variables).
# 
# If the request has a body and this setting is disabled, the body will be shown as [REDACTED].
# 
# This option is case-insensitive.
# NOTE: Currently, only `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (form parameters) are supported.
# Forms which include a file upload (`multipart/form-data`) are not supported.
# 
# WARNING: request bodies often contain sensitive values like passwords, credit card numbers etc.If your service handles data like this, we advise to only enable this feature with care.
#
# Valid options: off, errors, transactions, all
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: EventType
# Default value: OFF

# Used to restrict requests to certain URLs from being instrumented.
# 
# This property should be set to an array containing one or more strings.
# When an incoming HTTP request is detected, its URL will be tested against each element in this list.
# 
# NOTE: A wildcard expression may either contain a single wildcard in the middle or have wildcards at the beginning and/or the end. Legal: `*foo*`, `foo*`, `*foo`, `foo*bar*`. Illegal: `foo*bar*`, `foo*bar*baz`.
# Prepending an element with `(?i)` makes the matching case-insensitive.
# 
# NOTE: All errors that are captured during a request to an ignored URL are still sent to the APM Server regardless of this setting.

# In its default settings, the APM agent will collect a stack trace with every recorded span.
# While this is very helpful to find the exact place in your code that causes the span, collecting this stack trace does have some overhead. 
# When setting this option to `-1`, stack traces will be collected for all spans. Setting it to a positive value, e.g. `5`, will limit stack trace collection to spans with durations equal or longer than the given value in milliseconds, e.g. 5 milliseconds.
#
