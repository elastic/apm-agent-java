[[trouble-shooting]]
== Troubleshooting
Something isn't quite working as expected?
Here are some guidelines how to find out what's going wrong.

As a first step, please check if your stack is compatible with the currently <<supported-technologies,supported technologies>>.

Don't worry if you can't figure out what the problem is.
Open a topic in the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[APM discuss forum]
and we will help you out.

IMPORTANT: If you do so, *please attach your debug logs* so that we can analyze the problem.
Upload the *complete* logs to a service like https://gist.github.com.
The logs should include everything from the application startup up until the first request has been executed.

[[trouble-shooting-logging]]
=== Logging
There are several <<config-logging, logging related configuration options>>.
The most important one is <<config-log-level>>.
Set the log level to `DEBUG` or even `TRACE` to get more information about the behavior of the agent.
The `TRACE` log level is even more verbose than `DEBUG` and prints a stack trace every time a transaction or span is started or stopped.
Also, the JSON documents which are sent to the APM server will be logged on `TRACE` level.

Please always post the whole content of your log files when asking for help.

When the agent starts up,
you should see logs similar to these:

----
[main] INFO co.elastic.apm.agent.configuration.StartupInfo - Starting Elastic APM (unknown version) on Java 10 (Oracle Corporation) Mac OS X 10.13.6
[apm-server-healthcheck] INFO co.elastic.apm.agent.report.ApmServerHealthChecker - Elastic APM server is available: {"build_date":"2018-11-05T07:58:08Z","build_sha":"dffb98a72a262ca22adad0152f0245ea743ea904","version":"7.0.0-alpha1"}

[main] DEBUG co.elastic.apm.agent.configuration.StartupInfo - log_level: 'DEBUG' (source: Java System Properties)
----

Make sure to execute some requests to your application before posting your log files.
Each request should at least add some lines similar to these in the logs:

----

----

If you don't see anything in your logs,
the technology stack you are using is probably not <<supported-technologies-details,supported>>.

After that, you should see logs indicating that the agent has successfully sent data to the APM server:

----
[apm-request-timeout-timer] DEBUG co.elastic.apm.agent.report.IntakeV2ReportingEventHandler - Request flush because the request timeout occurred
[apm-reporter] DEBUG co.elastic.apm.agent.report.IntakeV2ReportingEventHandler - Receiving FLUSH event (sequence 26)
[apm-reporter] DEBUG co.elastic.apm.agent.report.IntakeV2ReportingEventHandler - Flushing 10912 uncompressed 2667 compressed bytes
----

If the APM server responds with a 400,
it could indicate JSON validation errors.
The log would then contain the actual documents which failed to validate:

----
[apm-reporter] INFO co.elastic.apm.agent.report.IntakeV2ReportingEventHandler - Backing off for 0 seconds (Â±10%)
[apm-reporter] WARN co.elastic.apm.agent.report.IntakeV2ReportingEventHandler - Server returned HTTP response code: 400 for URL: http://localhost:8200/intake/v2/events

[[trouble-shooting-debugging]]
=== Debugging
Sometimes reading the logs is just not enough to debug a problem.
As the agent is OpenSource and released on Maven Central,
debugging the agent code is really easy.

In order for your IDE to download the sources,
first declare a dependency to the agent.

NOTE: The agent is added via the `-javaagent` flag.
So you have to make sure that you declare the dependency in a way that the agent is not on the classpath twice.
For example,
when you are developing a web application,
make sure that the agent is not packaged in your war in `WEB-INF/lib`.
In the debug window of your IDE,
make sure that `elastic-apm-agent` does not appear in the `-classpath`.

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.elastic.apm</groupId>
    <artifactId>elastic-apm-agent</artifactId>
    <version>${elastic-apm.version}</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: Even when setting the `scope` to `provided`,
IntelliJ sometimes adds the agent on the classpath anyway.
One workaround is to set the `scope` to `test`.

=== Common problems

[float]
[[trouble-shooting-no-data]]
==== There is no data in the Kibana APM UI

The most common source of this problem are connection issues between the agent and the APM server.

If the APM server does not receive data from the agent,
check if the agent is able to establish a connection to the server.
In the agent logs,
look out for logs containing `Elastic APM server is available`
and `Elastic APM server is not available`.

If you see the message `Elastic APM server is not available`,
the agent has problems connecting to the APM server.
Check the setting of <<config-server-urls>> and make sure the agent is able to connect to the server.
Try to execute `curl -v <apm-server-url>/healthcheck` from the machine the agent is running on.
The server should respond with a 200 status code.

If the APM server does not respond successfully,
have a look at the APM server logs to verify that the server is actually running.
Also make sure to configure your firewalls so that the host the agent runs on can open HTTP connections to the APM server.

[float]
[[trouble-shooting-old-jdbc-drivers]]
==== Libraries compiled against old Java versions

If you are seeing warning like these in your application,
it means that you are using a library which has been compiled for a very old version of Java:

----
org.apache.commons.dbcp.DelegatingStatement uses an unsupported class file version (pre Java 5) and can't be instrumented.
Consider updating to a newer version of that library.
----

That mostly concerns JDBC drivers.
Updating them to a more recent version should resolve the problem.

[float]
[[trouble-shooting-incorrect-manual-jar-file]]
==== Failed to find Premain-Class manifest attribute ====

If you are using a manual setup with a `-javaagent` flag against an application server and are seeing the 
`Failed to find Premain-Class manifest attribute` error and a failure to start, then you might be pointing
at the incorrect jar file.

The correct jar file to be pointing at should be in the form of `elastic-apm-agent-<version>.jar` and 
further information about how to download this file can be found <<setup-javaagent, in the manual setup instructions.>>
