== Set up

There are three different ways to set up the Elastic APM Java Agent:

. <<setup-javaagent>> - Manually set up and configure the agent with the `-javaagent` JVM flag.
. <<setup-attach-cli>> - Automatically set up the agent without needing to alter the configuration of your application server.
. <<setup-attach-api>> - Use the `apm-agent-attach` artifact and the `attach` API to set up the agent.
