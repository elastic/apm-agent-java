[[setup]]
== Set up

There are three different ways to set up the Elastic APM Java Agent:

. <<setup-javaagent>> - Manually set up and configure the agent with the `--javaagent` JVM flag.
. <<setup-attach-cli>> - Automatically set up the agent without needing to alter the configuration of your application server.
. <<setup-attach-api>> - Use the `apm-agent-attach` artifact and the `attach` API to set up the agent.

[[setup-javaagent]]
=== Manual setup with `--javaagent` flag

[float]
[[setup-javaagent-download]]
==== Download the Java agent

The first step in getting started with the Elastic APM Java agent is to download the latest release of the agent jar file from
link:https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:co.elastic.apm%20AND%20a:elastic-apm-agent[maven central].

NOTE: Don't declare a dependency to the agent in your application.


[float]
[[setup-javaagent-add-flag]]
==== Add `javaagent` flag
When starting your application, add the JVM flag `-javaagent:/path/to/elastic-apm-agent-<version>.jar`

See <<application-server-setup>> for server specific installation instructions.

[[setup-attach-cli]]
=== Automatic setup with `apm-agent-attach.jar`

NOTE: This installation method is experimental.

You can use the attacher as a standalone application on the command line or include it in your application to programmatically attach to the current JVM.

This installation method does not require you to alter the configuration of your application server and can be used to conveniently instrument all JVMs on a particular host.

The `apm-agent-attach.jar` is a small Java program which attaches the Elastic APM Java agent to a specific JVM or to all JVMs of the same host it runs on.
This requires that the OS user executing `apm-agent-attach.jar` and the OS user of the application(s) to be monitored (the JVMs to attach to) is the same.


[float]
[[setup-attach-cli-download]]
==== Download

You can download the attach program from maven central:
link:https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:co.elastic.apm%20AND%20a:apm-agent-attach[maven central]


[float]
[[setup-attach-cli-usage]]
==== Usage

[float]
[[setup-attach-cli-usage-pid]]
===== Attach to a JVM with a specific PID

Attaches the agent to a JVM with a specific process ID.
Optionally, you can pass in arguments to configure the agent.
See <<setup-attach-cli-usage-options>> for the format of the agent arguments.

[source,bash]
----
java -jar apm-agent-attach.jar --pid <pid> [--args <agent_arguments>]
----

Example: The following command attaches the agent to the JVM with the PID 42 and exits.
Additionally, it applies some <<configuration,configuration options>>.

[source,bash]
----
java -jar apm-agent-attach.jar --pid 42 \
    --args 'service_name=my-cool-service;server_urls=http://localhost:8200'
----

[float]
[[setup-attach-cli-usage-filtered]]
===== Attach to a filtered set of JVMs on a certain host

Attaches the agent to all matching JVMs on the host which confirm to the optional include and exclude filters.

[source,bash]
----
java -jar apm-agent-attach.jar [-include <include_pattern>...]
       [-exclude <exclude_pattern>...] [--continuous]
       [--args <agent_arguments> | --args-provider <args_provider_script>]
----

Example: The following command attaches the agent to all JVMs whose main class contains `MyApplication` or which are started from a jar file named `my-application.jar`.
It also makes the attacher run continuously so that it attaches the agent on starting JVMs which match the include pattern.
Additionally, it applies some <<configuration,configuration options>>.

[source,bash]
----
java -jar apm-agent-attach.jar \
    --include '.*MyApplication.*' '.*/my-application.jar' \
    --continuous \
    --args 'service_name=my-cool-service;server_urls=http://localhost:8200'
----

[float]
[[setup-attach-cli-usage-list]]
===== List running JVMs

Lists all currently running JVMs, including their PID and their main class name or the path to their jar file.

[source,bash]
----
java -jar apm-agent-attach.jar --list
----

[float]
[[setup-attach-cli-usage-options]]
===== Options

*-l, --list*::
+
--
Lists all running JVMs. Same output as `jps -l`.
--

*-p, --pid <pid>*::
+
--
PID of the JVM to attach. If not provided, attaches to all currently running JVMs which match the `--exclude` and `--include` filters.

NOTE: this option cannot be used in conjunction with `--continuous`, `--exclude`, `--include` and `--args-provider`
--

*-c, --continuous*::
+
--
If provided, this program continuously runs and attaches to all running and starting JVMs which match the `--exclude` and `--include` filters.

NOTE: this option cannot be used in conjunction with `--pid`
--

*-e, --exclude <exclude_pattern>...*::
+
--
A list of regular expressions of fully qualified main class names or paths to JARs of applications the java agent should not be attached to.
(Matches the output of `jps -l`)

NOTE: this option cannot be used in conjunction with `--pid`
--

*-i, --include <include_pattern>...*::
+
--
A list of regular expressions of fully qualified main class names or paths to JARs of applications the java agent should be attached to.
(Matches the output of `jps -l`)

NOTE: this option cannot be used in conjunction with `--pid`
--

*-a, --args <agent_arguments>*::
+
--
If set, the arguments are used to configure the agent on the attached JVM (agentArguments of agentmain).

The syntax of the arguments is `key1=value1;key2=value1,value2`.
See <<configuration>> for all available configuration options.

NOTE: this option cannot be used in conjunction with `--args-provider`
--

*-A, --args-provider <args_provider_script>*::
+
--
The name of a program which is called when a new JVM starts up.
The program gets the pid and the main class name or path to the JAR file as an argument
and returns an arg string which is used to configure the agent on the attached JVM (agentArguments of agentmain).
When returning a non-zero status code from this program, the agent will not be attached to the starting JVM.

The syntax of the arguments is `key1=value1;key2=value1,value2`.
See <<configuration>> for all available configuration options.

NOTE: this option cannot be used in conjunction with `--pid` and `--args`
--

[[setup-attach-api]]
=== Programmatic API setup to self-attach

NOTE: This installation method is experimental.

Declare a dependency to the link:https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:co.elastic.apm%20AND%20a:apm-agent-attach[`apm-agent-attach`] artifact.

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.elastic.apm</groupId>
    <artifactId>apm-agent-attach</artifactId>
    <version>${elastic-apm.version}</version>
</dependency>
----


Call `ElasticApmAttacher.attach()` in the first line of your `public static void main(String[] args)` method.

This example demonstrates the the usage of the `attach` API with a simple Spring Boot application:

[source,java]
.MyApplication.java
----
import co.elastic.apm.attach.ElasticApmAttacher;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ElasticApmAttacher.attach();
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----

NOTE: The API is not limited to Spring Boot and does not require Spring Boot, it is just used for demonstration purposes.
