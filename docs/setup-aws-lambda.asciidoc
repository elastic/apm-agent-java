=== Get started with Lambda (Experimental)

experimental::[]

Getting Elastic APM set up for your lambda functions is easy,
and there are various ways you can tweak it to fit your needs.

NOTE: In order to get the full AWS Lambda tracing capabilities, use with APM Server 7.16 or higher. Using
older versions provides most value, but some relevant metadata fields will not be indexed.

[[aws-lambda-installation]]
==== Installation

Setting up your Lambda function is a two-step process.

1. <<aws-lambda-extension>>
2. <<aws-lambda-instrumenting>>

[float]
[[aws-lambda-extension]]
==== Install the Elastic APM Lambda extension

Elastic uses a Lambda extension to forward data to APM Server in a way that does not interfere with the
execution of your Lambda function.

See the https://github.com/elastic/apm-aws-lambda/blob/main/docs/aws-lambda-extension.asciidoc[installation documentation] to get started.

NOTE: Not all environment variables specified within https://github.com/elastic/apm-aws-lambda/blob/main/docs/aws-lambda-extension.asciidoc#the-necessary-variables[The Necessary Variables]
section of the extension documentation need to be configured. The Java agent utilizes a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-modify.html[wrapper script]
to set some of these up, so follow the next section to see which are required.

[[aws-lambda-instrumenting]]
==== Installing the Elastic APM Java Agent layer

The Java Agent is installed as an AWS Layer as well. It is distributed as a ZIP archive containing two files:

- The Java Agent jar file
- A wrapper script that sets up the runtime to enable automatic attachment of the agent

Follow these steps to ensure proper Java Agent attachment to your Lambda function:

1. Download the `elastic-apm-java-aws-lambda-layer-<VERSION>.zip` archive from our
https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/releases[GitHub Releases page].
2. Publish the downloaded ZIP archive as an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-layers.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_help[AWS Lambda Layer].
3. Configure your function to use the Java Agent layer.
4. Within your Function configuration, configure the following environment variables:
a. `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER` (required): set this variable's value to `/opt/elastic-apm-handler`, so that Lambda starts the runtime with this script.
b. `ELASTIC_APM_LAMBDA_APM_SERVER` (required): this will tell the Elastic APM Extension where to send data to.
c. `ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN` or `ELASTIC_APM_API_KEY` (required): see the relevant https://github.com/elastic/apm-aws-lambda/blob/main/docs/aws-lambda-extension.asciidoc#the-necessary-variables[documentation].
d. <<config-application-packages, `ELASTIC_APM_APPLICATION_PACKAGES`>> (recommended): setting this may improve cold start times.
5. Fine-tune the Java agent with any of the available <<configuration, configuration options>>.

That's it, if you've done all of the above you are set to go!
Your Lambda function invocations should be traced from now on.

[[aws-lambda-performance-monitoring]]
==== Performance monitoring

Elastic APM automatically measures the performance of your lambda function executions.
It records traces for database queries, external HTTP requests,
and other slow operations that happen during execution.

By default, the agent will trace <<supported-technologies,the usual supported technologies>>.
To trace other events, take a look at <<java-method-monitoring, additional method tracing options>>, however note that
due to its asynchronous nature, the <<method-sampling-based, Sampling Profiler>> is not a valid option for AWS Lambda.

[float]
[[aws-lambda-error-monitoring]]
==== Error monitoring

Whenever an `Exception` is thrown by your function handler method, the agent will send an error event to the APM Server
and the corresponding transaction will be recorded as a failed transaction.
Errors related to traced spans will be sent as well.

[float]
[[aws-lambda-caveats]]
==== Caveats
- System and custom metrics are not collected for Lambda functions. This is both because most of those are irrelevant
and because the interval-based event sending model is not suitable for FaaS environments.
- Cold starts can be significantly slower when the agent is installed. The higher memory limit you would allow for your
Function, the smaller this effect would be. This doesn't affect memory usage for subsequent Function invocations,
it is only relevant for cold starts.
- The <<method-sampling-based,Sampling Profiler>> feature would not work because it relies on profiling sessions and
subsequent asynchronous processing of the collected data.
