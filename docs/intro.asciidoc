== Introduction

Welcome to the APM Java Agent documentation.

Elastic APM automatically measures the performance of your application and tracks errors.
It records spans for database queries,
incoming HTTP requests,
and other slow operations that happen during requests to your app.

Spans are grouped in transactions - by default one for each incoming HTTP request.
But it's possible to create custom transactions not associated with an HTTP request.

By default the agent comes with support for common frameworks out-of-the-box.
To instrument other events,
you can use custom spans.
For information about custom spans,
see the link:public-api.asciidoc[public api documentation].

NOTE: The agent does not yet support automatic instrumentation via `-javaagent`,
however this is something which is definitely on our roadmap.
So for the time being,
you will have to manually integrate the agent into your application.

The agent is only one of multiple components you need to get started with APM.
Please also have a look at the documentation for

[[get-started]]
=== Get started

The first step in getting started with the Elastic APM Java agent ist to declare a dependency on the agent:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.elastic.apm</groupId>
    <artifactId>apm-agent-java</artifactId>
    <version>${elastic-apm.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
compile "co.elastic.apm:apm-agent-java:$elasticApmVersion"
----

NOTE: Currently the agent is not yet published to maven central.
So you have to check out the agent and build it from source.
To do that,
simply execute
`git clone https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java.git && cd apm-agent-java && ./mvnw install`.


To get you off the ground, we've prepared guides for the most popular frameworks:

* link:plugin-jdbc.asciidoc[Get started with JDBC]
* link:plugin-spring-webmvc.asciidoc[Get started with Spring Web MVC]
* link:plugin-servlet.asciidoc[Get started with Servlet API]


=== Configuration
Once you are set with instrumenting your favorite framework,
see the link:configuration.asciidoc[configuration guide] on how to configure Elastic APM.

=== Requirements
The Elastic APM Java agent supports the Oracle and OpenJDK versions 7, 8 and 9.

To see the requirements for a specific framework,
see the corresponding getting started guide of that framework.
