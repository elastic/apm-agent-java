[[intro]]
== Introduction

Welcome to the APM Java Agent documentation.

Elastic APM automatically measures the performance of your application and tracks errors.
For example, it records spans for database queries and transactions for incoming HTTP requests.
See <<supported-technologies>> to learn about which frameworks and technologies the Elastic APM Java agent supports out-of-the-box.

Spans are grouped in transactions - by default one for each incoming HTTP request.
But it's possible to create custom transactions not associated with an HTTP request.

By default the agent comes with support for common frameworks out-of-the-box.
To instrument other events,
you can use custom spans.
For information about custom spans,
see the <<public-api,public api documentation>>.

NOTE: The minimum required version of the APM Server is 6.5.0
