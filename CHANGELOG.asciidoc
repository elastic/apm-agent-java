=== Unreleased

[[release-notes-x.x.x]]
==== 1.33.0 - YYYY/MM/DD

[float]
===== Features
* Add support for Spring WebClient - {pull}2229[#2229]
* Added undocumented and unsupported configuration `metric_set_limit` to increase the metric set limit - {pull}2148[#2148]
* Added <<config-transaction-name-groups, `transaction_name_groups`>> configuration option.
** Deprecated <<config-url-groups, `url_groups`>> in favor of <<config-transaction-name-groups, `transaction_name_groups`>>.

[float]
===== Bug fixes
* Fix for JAX-WS (SOAP) transaction names. The agent now properly names transaction for web service methods that are not annotated with `@WebMethod`. - {pull}2667[#2667]
* Fix public API backward compatibility that was broken in 1.32.0. With this version you can use any version of the public API once
again - {pull}2682[#2682]
* Fix flaky transaction name with Webflux+Servlet - {pull}2695[#2695]

[[release-notes-1.x]]
=== Java Agent version 1.x

[[release-notes-1.32.0]]
==== 1.32.0 - 2022/06/13

===== Potentially breaking changes
* If using the public API of version < 1.32.0 and using the `@CaptureSpan` or `@Traced` annotations, upgrading the agent to 1.32.0
without upgrading the API version may cause `VerifyError`. This was fixed in version 1.33.0, which can once again be used with any
version of the public API.
* For relational databases, the agent now captures the database name and makes it part of service dependencies and service map.
For example, with a `MySQL` database, previously a single `mysql` item was shown in the map and in service dependencies,
the agent will now include the database name in the dependency, thus `mysql/my-db1`, `mysql/my-db2` will now be captured.

[float]
===== Features
* Promote mature agent features as Generaly Available (GA) - {pull}2632[#2632]
** <<opentelemetry-bridge,OpenTelemetry bridge>> is now enabled by default
** <<config-circuit-breaker,Circuit breaker>> marked as GA (still disabled by default)
** <<setup-attach-api,API Attach>> and <<setup-attach-cli,CLI Attach>> marked as GA
** <<config-use-path-as-transaction-name,`use_path_as_transaction_name`>> configuration option marked as GA
** Dubbo instrumentation is now enabled by default
** `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` instrumentation marked as GA
* Struts action invocations via an action chain result start a new span - {pull}2513[#2513]
* Added official support for Elasticsearch Java API client - {pull}2211[#2211]
* Added the ability to make spans non-discardable through the public API and the OpenTelemetry bridge - {pull}2632[#2632]
* Added support for the new service target fields - {pull}2578[#2578]
* Capture the database name from JDBC connection string - {pull}2642[#2642]
* Added an additional span around Javalin template renderers - {pull}2381[#2381]
* Added support for downloading the latest agent version through the attach CLI by setting `--download-agent-version latest`. In
addition, when using the `apm-agent-attach-cli-slim.jar`, which does not contain a bundled agent, the latest version will be downloaded
from maven at runtime unless configured otherwise through  `--download-agent-version` - {pull}2659[#2659]
* Added span-links to messaging systems instrumentation (supported by APM Server 8.3+ only) - {pull}2610[#2610]

[float]
===== Bug fixes
* Fix missing attributes in bridged OTel transactions - {pull}2657[#2657]
* Fix `transaction.result` with bridged OTel transactions - {pull}2660[#2660]

[[release-notes-1.31.0]]
==== 1.31.0 - 2022/05/17

[float]
===== Potentially breaking changes
* Starting this version, when using <<config-log-ecs-reformatting>>, the agent will automatically set the `service.version` field.
If you are using ECS-logging and set the `service.version` through a custom field, the behaviour is not strictly defined. Remove the
custom `service.name` field setting and either allow the agent to automatically discover and set it, or use the
<<config-service-version>> config option to set it manually.

[float]
===== Refactorings
* Vert.x 3.x instrumentation was refactored to remove constructor instrumentation as well as wrapping of response handler. In addition, in
HTTP 2 request handling, transactions are ended when the request end event occurs and are kept alive until response end, when they are allowed
to recycle. This allows for spans representing asynchronous handling of requests for which the corresponding transaction has ended -
{pull}2564[#2564]
* Jedis clients instrumentation was changed

[float]
===== Features
* Set the service version when using the ECS reformatting of the application logs: {pull}2603[#2603]
* Add ECS-reformatting support for `java.util.logging` - {pull}2591[#2591]
* Added support for setting the service version on Log4j2's EcsLayout - {pull}2604[#2604]
* Added support for AWS S3 and DynamoDB - {pull}2606[#2606]
* Added support for Jedis 4.x clients - {pull}2626[#2626]

[float]
===== Bug fixes
* Fixed multiple dropped stats types in a transaction producing invalid JSON: {pull}2589[#2589]
* Fixed NoClassDefFoundError when using OTel bridge and span.*current() : {pull}2596[#2596]
* Fallback to standard output when Security Manager prevents writing to log file - {pull}2581[#2581]
* Fix missing transactions when using Vert.x 3.x with HTTP 1 - {pull}2564[#2564]
* Fix Vert.x `GET null` transactions to be named `GET unknown route`, according to spec - {pull}2564[#2564]
* Fix OpenTelemetry bridge span end with explicit timestamp - {pull}2615[#2615]
* Fix improper naming for `scheduled` transactions created by `java.util.TimerTask` instrumentation - {pull}2620[#2620]
* Properly handle `java.lang.IllegalStateException` related to premature invocation of `ServletConfig#getServletContext()` in
`Servlet#init()` instrumentations - {pull}2627[#2627]

[[release-notes-1.30.1]]
==== 1.30.1 - 2022/04/12

[[release-notes-1.30.0]]
==== 1.30.0 - 2022/03/22

[float]
===== Potentially breaking changes
* Create the JDBC spans as exit spans- {pull}2484[#2484]
* WebSocket requests are now captured with transaction type request instead of custom - {pull}2501[#2501]

[float]
===== Refactorings
* Logging frameworks instrumentations - {pull}2428[#2428]. This refactoring includes:
** Log correlation now works based on bytecode instrumentation rather than `ActivationListener` that directly updates the MDC
** Merging the different instrumentations (log-correlation, error-capturing and ECS-reformatting) into a single plugin
** Module structure and package naming changes

[float]
===== Features
* Added support for setting service name and version for a transaction via the public api - {pull}2451[#2451]
* Added support for en-/disabling each public annotation on each own - {pull}2472[#2472]

to the AWS Lambda extension - {pull}2424[#2424]
* Changed logging correlation to be on by default. This change includes the removal of the now redundant `enable_log_correlation` config
option. If there's a need to disable the log correlation mechanism, this can be done now through the `disable_instrumentations` config -
{pull}2428[#2428]
* Added automatic error event capturing for log4j1 and JBoss LogManager - {pull}2428[#2428]
* Issue a warning when security manager is mis-configured - {pull}2510[#2510]
* Add experimental OpenTelemetry API bridge - {pull}1631[#1631]

[float]
===== Performance improvements
* Proxy classes are excluded from instrumentation in more cases - {pull}2474[#2474]
* Only time type/method matching if the debug logging is enabled as the results are only used when debug logging is enabled - {pull}2471[#2471]

[float]
===== Bug fixes
* Fix cross-plugin dependencies triggering NoClassDefFound - {pull}2509[#2509]
* Fix status code setting in AWS Lambda transactions triggered by API Gateway V1 - {pull}2346[#2346]

[[release-notes-1.29.0]]
==== 1.29.0 - 2022/02/09

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* Changes in service name auto-discovery of jar files (see Features section)

[float]
===== Features
* Exceptions that are logged using the fatal log level are now captured (log4j2 only) - {pull}2377[#2377]
* Replaced `authorization` in the default value of `sanitize_field_names` with `*auth*` - {pull}2326[#2326]
* Unsampled transactions are dropped and not sent to the APM-Server if the APM-Server version is 8.0+ - {pull}2329[#2329]
* Adding agent logging capabilities to our SDK, making it available for external plugins - {pull}2390[#2390]
* Service name auto-discovery improvements
** For applications deployed to application servers (`war` files) and standalone jars that are started with `java -jar`,
   the agent now discovers the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file.
** If the manifest contains the `Implementation-Title` attribute, it is used as the default service name - {pull}1921[#1921], {pull}2434[#2434] +
  *Note*: this may change your service names if you relied on the auto-discovery that uses the name of the jar file.
  If that jar file also contains an `Implementation-Title` attribute in the `MANIFEST.MF` file, the latter will take precedence.
** When the manifest contains the `Implementation-Version` attribute, it is used as the default service version - {pull}1726[#1726], {pull}1922[#1922], {pull}2434[#2434]
* Added support for instrumenting Struts 2 static resource requests - {pull}1949[#1949]

paths. The BCI warmup is on by default and may be disabled through the internal `warmup_byte_buddy` config option - {pull}2368[#2368]
* Fixed few dubbo plugin issues - {pull}2149[#2149]
** Dubbo transaction will should be created at the provider side

[[release-notes-1.27.0]]
==== 1.27.0 - 2021/11/15

[float]
===== Security
* Resolves Local Privilege Escalation issue https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apm-java-agent-security-update/289627[ESA-2021-29] https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37941[CVE-2021-37941]

[float]
===== Potentially breaking changes
* `transaction_ignore_urls` now relies on full request URL path - {pull}2146[#2146]
** On a typical application server like Tomcat, deploying an `app.war` application to the non-ROOT context makes it accessible with `http://localhost:8080/app/`
** Ignoring the whole webapp through `/app/*` was not possible until now.
** Existing configuration may need to be updated to include the deployment context, thus for example `/static/*.js` used to
exclude known static files in all applications might be changed to `/app/static/*.js` or `*/static/*.js`.
** It only impacts prefix patterns due to the additional context path in pattern.
** It does not impact deployment within the `ROOT` context like Spring-boot which do not have such context path prefix.
* The metrics `transaction.duration.sum.us`, `transaction.duration.count` and `transaciton.breakdown.count` are no longer recorded - {pull}2194[#2194]
* Automatic hostname discovery mechanism had changed, so the resulted `host.name` and `host.hostname` in events reported
by the agent may be different. This was done in order to improve the integration with host metrics in the APM UI.

[float]
===== Features
* Improved capturing of logged exceptions when using Log4j2 - {pull}2139[#2139]
* Update to async-profiler 1.8.7 and set configured `safemode` at load time though a new system property - {pull}2165[#2165]
* Added support to capture `context.message.routing-key` in rabbitmq, spring amqp instrumentations - {pull}1767[#1767]
* Breakdown metrics are now tracked per service (when using APM Server 8.0) - {pull}2208[#2208]
* Add support for Spring AMQP batch API - {pull}1716[#1716]
* Add the (current) transaction name to the error (when using APM Server 8.0) - {pull}2235[#2235]
* The JVM/JMX metrics are reported for each service name individually (when using APM Server 8.0) - {pull}2233[#2233]
* Added <<config-span-stack-trace-min-duration,`span_stack_trace_min_duration`>> option.
 This replaces the now deprecated `span_frames_min_duration` option.
 The difference is that the new option has more intuitive semantics for negative values (never collect stack trace) and zero (always collect stack trace). - {pull}2220[#2220]
* Add support to Jakarta EE for JAX-WS - {pull}2247[#2247]
* Add support to Jakarta EE for JAX-RS - {pull}2248[#2248]
* Add support for Jakarta EE EJB annotations `@Schedule`, `@Schedules` - {pull}2250[#2250]

* Fix few Webflux exceptions and missing reactor module - {pull}2207[#2207]

[float]
===== Refactorings
* Loading the agent from an isolated class loader - {pull}2109[#2109]
* Refactorings in the `apm-agent-plugin-sdk` that may imply breaking changes for beta users of the external plugin mechanism
** `WeakMapSupplier.createMap()` is now `WeakConcurrent.buildMap()` and contains more builders - {pull}2136[#2136]
** `GlobalThreadLocal` has been removed in favor of `DetachedThreadLocal`. To make it global, use `GlobalVariables` - {pull}2136[#2136]
** `DynamicTransformer.Accessor.get().ensureInstrumented` is now `DynamicTransformer.ensureInstrumented` - {pull}2164[#2164]
** The `@AssignTo.*` annotations have been removed.
   Use the `@Advice.AssignReturned.*` annotations that come with the latest version of Byte Buddy.
   If your plugin uses the old annotations, it will be skipped.
   {pull}2171[#2171]
* Switching last instrumentations (`trace_methods`, sparkjava, JDK `HttpServer` and Struts 2) to
`TracerAwareInstrumentation` - {pull}2170[#2170]
* Replace concurrency plugin maps to `SpanConcurrentHashMap` ones - {pull}2173[#2173]

* Update ecs-logging-java to 1.3.0

[[release-notes-1.26.0]]
==== 1.26.0 - 2021/09/14

===== Potentially breaking changes
* If you rely on Database span subtype and use Microsoft SQL Server, the span subtype has been changed from `sqlserver`
to `mssql` to align with other agents.

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* Stop collecting the field `http.request.socket.encrypted` in http requests - {pull}2136[#2136]

[float]
===== Features
* Improved naming for Spring controllers - {pull}1906[#1906]
* ECS log reformatting improvements - {pull}1910[#1910]
** Automatically sets `service.node.name` in all log events if set through agent configuration
** Add `log_ecs_reformatting_additional_fields` option to support arbitrary fields in logs
** Automatically serialize markers as tags where relevant (log4j2 and logback)
* gRPC spans (client and server) can detect errors or cancellation through custom listeners - {pull}2067[#2067]
* Add `-download-agent-version` to the agent <<setup-attach-cli-usage-options, attach CLI tool options>>, allowing the
user to configure an arbitrary agent version that will be downloaded from maven and attached - {pull}1959[#1959]
* Add extra check to detect improper agent setup - {pull}2076[#2076]
* In redis tests - embedded RedisServer is replaced by testcontainers - {pull}2221[#2221]

[float]
===== Performance improvements
* Reduce GC time overhead caused by WeakReferences - {pull}2086[#2086], {pull}2081[#2081]
* Reduced memory overhead by a smarter type pool caching strategy - {pull}2102[#2102]. +
  The type pool cache improves the startup times by speeding up type matching
  (determining whether a class that's about to be loaded should be instrumented).
  Generally, the more types that are cached, the faster the startup. +
  The old strategy did not impose a limit to the cache but cleared it after it hasn't been accessed in a while.
  However, load test have discovered that the cache may never be cleared and leave a permanent overhead of 23mb.
  The actual size of the cache highly depends on the application and loosely correlates with the number of loaded classes. +
  The new caching strategy targets to allocate 1% of the committed heap, at least 0.5mb and max 10mb.
  If a particular entry hasn't been accessed within 20s, it will be removed from the cache. +
  The results based on load testing are very positive:
** Equivalent startup times (within the margins of error of the previous strategy)
** Equivalent allocation rate (within the margins of error of the previous strategy)
** Reduced avg heap utilization from 10%/15mb (previous strategy) to within margins of error without the agent
** Reduced GC time due to the additional headroom that the application can utilize.
** Based on heap dump analysis, after warmup, the cache size is now around 59kb (down from 23mb with the previous strategy).

[float]
===== Bug fixes

[[release-notes-1.25.0]]
==== 1.25.0 - 2021/07/22

[float]
===== Potentially breaking changes
* If you rely on instrumentations that are in the `experimental` group, you must now set `enable_experimental_instrumentations=true` otherwise
the experimental instrumentations will be disabled by default. Up to version `1.24.0` using an empty value for `disable_instrumentations` was
the recommended way to override the default `disable_instrumentations=experimental`.

[float]
===== Features
* Support for inheritance of public API annotations - {pull}1805[#1805]
* JDBC instrumentation sets `context.db.instance` - {pull}1820[#1820]
* Add support for Vert.x web client- {pull}1824[#1824]
* Avoid recycling of spans and transactions that are using through the public API, so to avoid
reference-counting-related errors - {pull}1859[#1859]
* Add <<config-enable-experimental-instrumentations>> configuration option to enable experimental features - {pull}1863[#1863]
** Previously, when adding an instrumentation group to `disable_instrumentations`, we had to make sure to not forget the
default `experimental` value, for example when disabling `jdbc` instrumentation we had to set `disable_instrumentations=experimental,jdbc` otherwise
setting `disable_instrumentations=jdbc` would disable jdbc and also enable experimental features, which would not be the desired effect.
** Previously, by default `disable_instrumentations` contained `experimental`
** Now by default `disable_instrumentations` is empty and `enable_experimental_instrumentations=false`
** Set `enable_experimental_instrumentations=true` to enable experimental instrumentations
* Eliminating concerns related to log4j2 vulnerability - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9488#vulnCurrentDescriptionTitle.
We cannot upgrade to version above 2.12.1 because this is the last version of log4j that is compatible with Java 7.
Instead, we exclude the SMTP appender (which is the vulnerable one) from our artifacts. Note that older versions of
our agent are not vulnerable as well, as the SMTP appender was never used, this is only to further reduce our users' concerns.

[[release-notes-1.23.0]]
==== 1.23.0 - 2021/04/22

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* There are breaking changes in the <<setup-attach-cli,attacher cli>>.
  See the Features section for more information.

[float]
===== Features
* Overhaul of the <<setup-attach-cli,attacher cli>> application that allows to attach the agent to running JVMs - {pull}1667[#1667]
** The artifact of the standalone cli application is now called `apm-agent-attach-cli`. The attacher API is still called `apm-agent-attach`.
** There is also a slim version of the cli application that does not bundle the Java agent.
It requires the `--agent-jar` option to be set.
** Improved logging +
The application uses {ecs-logging-java-ref}/intro.html[Java ECS logging] to emit JSON logs.
The log level can be configured with the `--log-level` option.
By default, the program is logging to the console but using the `--log-file` option, it can also log to a file.
** Attach to JVMs running under a different user (unix only) +
The JVM requires the attacher to be running under the same user as the target VM (the attachee).
The `apm-agent-attach-standalone.jar` can now be run with a user that has permissions to switch to the user that runs the target VM.
On Windows, the attacher can still only attach to JVMs that are running with under the same user.
** New include/exclude discovery rules +
*** `--include-all`: Attach to all discovered JVMs. If no matchers are provided, it will not attach to any JVMs.
*** `--include-user`/`--exclude-user`: Attach to all JVMs of a given operating system user.
*** `--include-main`/`--exclude-main`: Attach to all JVMs that whose main class/jar name, or system properties match the provided regex.
*** `--include-vmargs`/`--exclude-vmargs`: Attach to all JVMs that whose main class/jar name, or system properties match the provided regex.
** Removal of options +
*** The deprecated `--arg` option has been removed.
*** The `-i`/`--include`, `-e`/`exclude` options have been removed in favor of the `--<include|exclude>-<main|vmargs>` options.
*** The `-p`/`--pid` options have been removed in favor of the `--include-pid` option.
** Changed behavior of  the `-l`/`--list` option +
The option now only lists JVMs that match the include/exclude discovery rules.
Thus, it can be used to do a dry-run of the matchers without actually performing an attachment.
It even works in combination with `--continuous` now.
By default, the VM arguments are not printed, but only when the `-a`/`--list-vmargs` option is set.
** Remove dependency on `jps` +
Even when matching on the main class name or on system properties,
** Checks the Java version before attaching to avoid attachment on unsupported JVMs.

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* Dots in metric names of Micrometer metrics get replaced with underscores to avoid mapping conflicts.
De-dotting be disabled via <<config-dedot-custom-metrics, `dedot_custom_metrics`>>. - {pull}1700[#1700]

[float]
===== Features
* Introducing a new mechanism to ease the development of community instrumentation plugins. See <<config-plugins-dir>> for
more details. This configuration was already added in 1.18.0, but more extensive and continuous integration testing
allows us to expose it now. It is still marked as "experimental" though, meaning that future changes in the mechanism
may break early contributed plugins. However, we highly encourage our community to try it out and we will do our best
to assist with such efforts.

* Adding capability to automatically create ECS-JSON-formatted version of the original application log files, through
the <<config-log-ecs-reformatting>> config option. This allows effortless ingestion of logs to Elasticsearch without
any further configuration. Supports log4j1, log4j2 and Logback. {pull}1261[#1261]
* Add support to Spring AMQP - {pull}1657[#1657]
* Adds the ability to automatically configure usage of the OpenTracing bridge in systems using ServiceLoader - {pull}1708[#1708]
* Update to async-profiler 1.8.5 - includes a fix to a Java 7 crash and enhanced safe mode to better deal with
corrupted stack frames.
* Add a warning on startup when `-Xverify:none` or `-noverify` flags are set as this can lead to crashes that are very
difficult to debug - {pull}1593[#1593]. In an upcoming version, the agent will not start when these flags are set,
unless the system property `elastic.apm.disable_bootstrap_checks` is set to true.

[float]
===== Bug fixes
* fix sample rate rounded to zero when lower than precision - {pull}1655[#1655]
* fixed a couple of bugs with the external plugin mechanism (not documented until now) - {pull}1660[#1660]
* Fix runtime attach conflict with multiple users - {pull}1704[#1704]

[[release-notes-1.21.0]]
==== 1.21.0 - 2021/02/09

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* Following PR {pull}1650[#1650], there are two slight changes with the <<config-server-url>> and <<config-server-urls>>
configuration options:
    1.  So far, setting `server_urls` with an empty string would allow the agent to work normally, apart from any action
        that requires communication with the APM Server, including the attempt to fetch a central configuration.
        Starting in this agent version, setting `server_urls` to empty string doesn't have any special meaning, it is
        the default expected configuration, where `server_url` will be used instead. In order to achieve the same
        behaviour, use the new <<config-disable-send>> configuration.
    2.  Up to this version, `server_url` was used as an alias to `server_urls`, meaning that one could potentially set
        the `server_url` config with a comma-separated list of multiple APM Server addresses, and that would have been a
        valid configuration. Starting in this agent version, `server_url` is a separate configuration, and it only accepts
        Strings that represent a single valid URL. Specifically, empty strings and commas are invalid.

[float]
===== Features
* Add cloud provider metadata to reported events, see
https://github.com/elastic/apm/blob/master/specs/agents/metadata.md#cloud-provider-metadata[spec] for details.
By default, the agent will try to automatically detect the cloud provider on startup, but this can be
configured through the <<config-cloud-provider, `cloud_provider`>> config option - {pull}1599[#1599]
* Add span & transaction `outcome` field to improve error rate calculations - {pull}1613[#1613]

[float]
===== Bug fixes
* Fixing crashes observed in Java 7 at sporadic timing by applying a few seconds delay on bootstrap - {pull}1594[#1594]
* Fallback to using "TLS" `SSLContext` when "SSL" is not available - {pull}1633[#1633]
* Fixing agent startup failure with `NullPointerException` thrown by Byte-buddy's `MultipleParentClassLoader` - {pull}1647[#1647]

[[release-notes-1.18.0.rc1]]
==== 1.18.0.RC1 - 2020/07/22

This release candidate adds some highly anticipated features:
It’s now possible to attach the agent at runtime in more cases than before.
Most notably, it enables runtime attachment on JBoss, WildFly, Glassfish/Payara,
and other OSGi runtimes such as Atlassian Jira and Confluence.

To make this and other significant features, such as https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/issues/937[external plugins], possible,
we have implemented major changes to the architecture of the agent.
The agent now relies on the `invokedynamic` bytecode instruction to make plugin development easier, safer, and more efficient.
As early versions of Java 7 and Java 8 have unreliable support for invokedynamic,
we now require a minimum update level of 60 for Java 7 (7u60+) in addition to the existing minimum update level of 40 for Java 8 (8u40+).

We’re looking for users who would like to try this out to give feedback.
If we see that the `invokedynamic`-based approach (https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/1230[indy plugins]) works well, we can continue and migrate the rest of the plugins.
After the migration has completed, we can move forward with external plugins and remove the experimental label from runtime attachment.

If all works like in our testing, you would not see `NoClassDefFoundError` s anymore when, for example, trying to attach the agent at runtime to an OSGi container or a JBoss server.
Also, non-standard OSGi containers, such as Atlassian Jira and other technologies with restrictive class loading policies, such as MuleSoft ESB, will benefit from this change.

In the worst case, there might be JVM crashes due to `invokedynamic`-related JVM bugs.
However, we already disable the agent when attached to JVM versions that are known to be problematic.
Another potentially problematic area is that we now dynamically raise the bytecode version of instrumented classes to be at least bytecode version 51 (Java 7).
This is needed in order to be able to use the `invokedynamic` instruction.
This requires re-computation of stack map frames which makes instrumentation a bit slower.
We don't anticipate notable slowdowns unless you extensively (over-)use <<config-trace-methods, `trace_methods`>>.

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* Early Java 7 versions, prior to update 60, are not supported anymore.
  When trying to attach to a non-supported version, the agent will disable itself and not apply any instrumentations.

[float]
===== Features
* Experimental support for runtime attachment now also for OSGi containers, JBoss, and WildFly
* New mitigation of OSGi bootdelegation errors (`NoClassDefFoundError`).
  You can remove any `org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation` related configuration.
  This release also removes the configuration option `boot_delegation_packages`.
* Overhaul of the `ExecutorService` instrumentation that avoids `ClassCastException` issues - {pull}1206[#1206]
* Support for `ForkJoinPool` and `ScheduledExecutorService` (see <<supported-async-frameworks>>)
* Support for `ExecutorService#invokeAny` and `ExecutorService#invokeAll`
* Added support for `java.util.TimerTask` - {pull}1235[#1235]
* Add capturing of request body in Elasticsearch queries: `_msearch`, `_count`, `_msearch/template`, `_search/template`, `_rollup_search` - {pull}1222[#1222]
* Add <<config-enabled,`enabled`>> flag
* Add experimental support for Scala Futures
* The agent now collects heap memory pools metrics - {pull}1228[#1228]

[float]
===== Bug fixes
* Fixes error capturing for log4j2 loggers. Version 1.17.0 introduced a regression.
* Fixes `NullPointerException` related to JAX-RS and Quartz instrumentation - {pull}1249[#1249]
* Expanding k8s pod ID discovery to some formerly non-supported environments
* When `recording` is set to `false`, the agent will not send captured errors anymore.
* Fixes NPE in Dubbo instrumentation that occurs when the application is acting both as a provider and as a consumer - {pull}1260[#1260]
* Adding a delay by default what attaching the agent to Tomcat using the premain route to work around the JUL
  deadlock issue - {pull}1262[#1262]

[[release-notes-1.17.0]]
==== 1.17.0 - 2020/06/17

[float]
===== Features
* Log files are now rotated after they reach <<config-log-file-size>>.
There will always be one history file `${log_file}.1`.
* Add <<config-log-format-sout>> and <<config-log-format-file>> with the options `PLAIN_TEXT` and `JSON`.
The latter uses https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging-java[ecs-logging-java] to format the logs.
* Exposing <<config-classes-excluded-from-instrumentation>> config - {pull}1187[#1187]
* Add support for naming transactions based on Grails controllers. Supports Grails 3+ - {pull}1171[#1171]
* Add support for the Apache/Alibaba Dubbo RPC framework
* Async Profiler version upgraded to 1.7.1, with a new debugging flag for the stack frame recovery mechanism - {pull}1173[#1173]

[float]
===== Bug fixes
* Fixes `IndexOutOfBoundsException` that can occur when profiler-inferred spans are enabled.
  This also makes the profiler more resilient by just removing the call tree related to the exception (which might be in an invalid state)
  as opposed to stopping the profiler when an exception occurs.
* Fix `NumberFormatException` when parsing Ingres/Actian JDBC connection strings - {pull}1198[#1198]
* Prevent agent from overriding JVM configured truststore when not using HTTPS for communication with APM server - {pull}1203[#1203]

[[release-notes-1.16.0]]
==== 1.16.0 - 2020/05/13

[float]
===== Features

* The log correlation feature now adds `error.id` to the MDC. See <<supported-logging-frameworks>> for details. - {pull}1050[#1050]
* Deprecating the `incubating` tag in favour of the `experimental` tag. This is not a breaking change, so former
<<config-disable-instrumentations,`disable_instrumentation`>> configuration containing the `incubating` tag will still be respected - {pull}1123[#1123]
* Add a `--without-emulated-attach` option for runtime attachment to allow disabling this feature as a workaround.
* Add workaround for JDK bug JDK-8236039 with TLS 1.3 {pull}1149[#1149]
* Add log level `OFF` to silence agent logging
* Adds <<config-span-min-duration,`span_min_duration`>> option to exclude fast executing spans.
  When set together with one of the more specific thresholds - `trace_methods_duration_threshold` or `profiling_inferred_spans_min_duration`,
  the higher threshold will determine which spans will be discarded.
* Automatically instrument quartz jobs from the quartz-jobs artifact {pull}1170[#1170]
* Perform re-parenting of regular spans to be a child of profiler-inferred spans. Requires APM Server and Kibana 7.8.0. {pull}1117[#1117]
* Upgrade Async Profiler version to 1.7.0

[float]
===== Bug fixes

* When Servlet-related Exceptions are handled through exception handlers that return a 200 status code, agent shouldn't override with 500 - {pull}1103[#1103]
* Exclude Quartz 1 from instrumentation to avoid
  `IncompatibleClassChangeError: Found class org.quartz.JobExecutionContext, but interface was expected` - {pull}1108[#1108]
* Fix breakdown metrics span sub-types {pull}1113[#1113]
* Fix flaky gRPC server instrumentation {pull}1122[#1122]
* Fix side effect of calling `Statement.getUpdateCount` more than once {pull}1139[#1139]
* Stop capturing JDBC affected rows count using `Statement.getUpdateCount` to prevent unreliable side-effects {pull}1147[#1147]
* Fix OpenTracing error tag handling (set transaction error result when tag value is `true`) {pull}1159[#1159]
* Due to a bug in the build we didn't include the gRPC plugin in the build so far
* `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Unable to load class 'jdk.internal...'` is thrown when tracing specific versions of Atlassian systems {pull}1168[#1168]
* Make sure spans are kept active during `AsyncHandler` methods in the `AsyncHttpClient`
* CPU and memory metrics are sometimes not reported properly when using IBM J9 {pull}1148[#1148]
* `NullPointerException` thrown by the agent on WebLogic {pull}1142[#1142]

[[release-notes-1.15.0]]
==== 1.15.0 - 2020/03/27

[float]
===== Breaking changes

* Ordering of configuration sources has slightly changed, please review <<configuration>>:
** `elasticapm.properties` file now has higher priority over java system properties and environment variables, +
This change allows to change dynamic options values at runtime by editing file, previously values set in java properties
or environment variables could not be overridden, even if they were dynamic.
* Renamed some configuration options related to the experimental profiler-inferred spans feature ({pull}1084[#1084]):
** `profiling_spans_enabled` -> `profiling_inferred_spans_enabled`
** `profiling_sampling_interval` -> `profiling_inferred_spans_sampling_interval`
** `profiling_spans_min_duration` -> `profiling_inferred_spans_min_duration`
** `profiling_included_classes` -> `profiling_inferred_spans_included_classes`
** `profiling_excluded_classes` -> `profiling_inferred_spans_excluded_classes`
** Removed `profiling_interval` and `profiling_duration` (both are fixed to 5s now)

[float]
===== Features

* Gracefully abort agent init when running on a known Java 8 buggy JVM {pull}1075[#1075].
* Add support for <<supported-databases, Redis Redisson client>>
* Makes <<config-instrument>>, <<config-trace-methods>>, and <<config-disable-instrumentations>> dynamic.
Note that changing these values at runtime can slow down the application temporarily.
* Do not instrument Servlet API before 3.0 {pull}1077[#1077]
* Add support for API keys for apm backend authentication {pull}1083[#1083]
* Add support for <<supported-rpc-frameworks, gRPC>> client & server instrumentation {pull}1019[#1019]
* Deprecating `active` configuration option in favor of `recording`.
  Setting `active` still works as it's now an alias for `recording`.

[float]
===== Bug fixes

* When JAX-RS-annotated method delegates to another JAX-RS-annotated method, transaction name should include method A - {pull}1062[#1062]
* Fixed bug that prevented an APM Error from being created when calling `org.slf4j.Logger#error` - {pull}1049[#1049]
* Wrong address in JDBC spans for Oracle, MySQL and MariaDB when multiple hosts are configured - {pull}1082[#1082]
* Document and re-order configuration priorities {pull}1087[#1087]
* Improve heuristic for `service_name` when not set through config {pull}1097[#1097]


[[release-notes-1.14.0]]
==== 1.14.0 - 2020/03/04

[float]
===== Features

* Support for the official https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context[W3C] `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers. +
  The agent now accepts both the `elastic-apm-traceparent` and the official `traceparent` header.
By default, it sends both headers on outgoing requests, unless <<config-use-elastic-traceparent-header, `use_elastic_traceparent_header`>> is set to false.
* Creating spans for slow methods with the help of the sampling profiler https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler[async-profiler].
This is a low-overhead way of seeing which methods make your transactions slow and a replacement for the `trace_methods` configuration option.
See <<supported-java-methods>> for more details
* Adding a Circuit Breaker to pause the agent when stress is detected on the system and resume when the stress is relieved.
See <<circuit-breaker>> and {pull}1040[#1040] for more info.
* `Span#captureException` and `Transaction#captureException` in public API return reported error id - {pull}1015[#1015]

[float]
===== Bug fixes

* java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot resolve type description for <com.another.commercial.apm.agent.Class> - {pull}1037[#1037]
* properly handle `java.sql.SQLException` for unsupported JDBC features {pull}[#1035] https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/issues/1025[#1025]

[[release-notes-1.13.0]]
==== 1.13.0 - 2020/02/11

[float]
===== Features

* Add support for <<supported-databases, Redis Lettuce client>>
* Add `context.message.age.ms` field for JMS message receiving spans and transactions - {pull}970[#970]
* Instrument log4j2 Logger#error(String, Throwable) ({pull}919[#919]) Automatically captures exceptions when calling `logger.error("message", exception)`
* Add instrumentation for external process execution through `java.lang.Process` and Apache `commons-exec` - {pull}903[#903]
* Add `destination` fields to exit span contexts - {pull}976[#976]
* Removed `context.message.topic.name` field - {pull}993[#993]
* Add support for Kafka clients - {pull}981[#981]
* Add support for binary `traceparent` header format (see the https://github.com/elastic/apm/blob/master/docs/agent-development.md#Binary-Fields[spec]
for more details) - {pull}1009[#1009]
* Add support for log correlation for log4j and log4j2, even when not used in combination with slf4j.
  See <<supported-logging-frameworks>> for details.

[float]
===== Bug Fixes

* Spans are not closed if JDBC implementation does not support `getUpdateCount` {pull}1008[#1008]

[[release-notes-1.12.0]]
==== 1.12.0 - 2019/11/21

[float]
===== Features
* JMS Enhancements {pull}911[#911]:
** Add special handling for temporary queues/topics
** Capture message bodies of text Messages
*** Rely on the existing `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_BODY` agent config option (off by default).
*** Send as `context.message.body`
*** Limit size to 10000 characters. If longer than this size, trim to 9999 and append with ellipsis
** Introduce the `ignore_message_queues` configuration to disable instrumentation (message tagging) for specific
      queues/topics as suggested in {pull}710[#710]
** Capture predefined message headers and all properties
*** Rely on the existing `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_HEADERS` agent config option.
*** Send as `context.message.headers`
*** Sanitize sensitive headers/properties based on the `sanitize_field_names` config option
* Added support for the MongoDB sync driver. See <<supported-databases, supported data stores>>.

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* JDBC regression- `PreparedStatement#executeUpdate()` and `PreparedStatement#executeLargeUpdate()` are not traced {pull}918[#918]
* When systemd cgroup driver is used, the discovered Kubernetes pod UID contains "_" instead of "-" {pull}920[#920]
* DB2 jcc4 driver is not traced properly {pull}926[#926]

[[release-notes-1.11.0]]
==== 1.11.0 - 2019/10/31

[float]
===== Features
* Add the ability to configure a unique name for a JVM within a service through the
<<config-service-node-name, `service_node_name`>>
config option]
* Add ability to ignore some exceptions to be reported as errors <<config-ignore-exceptions[ignore_exceptions]
* Applying new logic for JMS `javax.jms.MessageConsumer#receive` so that, instead of the transaction created for the
   polling method itself (ie from `receive` start to end), the agent will create a transaction attempting to capture
   the code executed during actual message handling.
   This logic is suitable for environments where polling APIs are invoked within dedicated polling threads.
   This polling transaction creation strategy can be reversed through a configuration option (`message_polling_transaction_strategy`)
   that is not exposed in the properties file by default.
* Send IP obtained through `javax.servlet.ServletRequest#getRemoteAddr()` in `context.request.socket.remote_address`
   instead of parsing from headers {pull}889[#889]
* Added `ElasticApmAttacher.attach(String propertiesLocation)` to specify a custom properties location
* Logs message when `transaction_max_spans` has been exceeded {pull}849[#849]
* Report the number of affected rows by a SQL statement (UPDATE,DELETE,INSERT) in 'affected_rows' span attribute {pull}707[#707]
* Add <<public-api, `@Traced`>> annotation which either creates a span or a transaction, depending on the context
* Report JMS destination as a span/transaction context field {pull}906[#906]
* Added <<config-capture-jmx-metrics, `capture_jmx_metrics`>> configuration option

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* JMS creates polling transactions even when the API invocations return without a message
* Support registering MBeans which are added after agent startup

[[release-notes-1.10.0]]
==== 1.10.0 - 2019/09/30

[float]
===== Features
* Add ability to manually specify reported <<config-hostname, hostname>>
* Add support for <<supported-databases, Redis Jedis client>>.
* Add support for identifying target JVM to attach apm agent to using JVM property. See also the documentation of the <<setup-attach-cli-usage-options, `--include` and `--exclude` flags>>
* Added <<config-capture-jmx-metrics, `capture_jmx_metrics`>> configuration option
* Improve servlet error capture {pull}812[#812]
  Among others, now also takes Spring MVC `@ExceptionHandler`s into account
* Instrument Logger#error(String, Throwable) {pull}821[#821]
  Automatically captures exceptions when calling `logger.error("message", exception)`
* Easier log correlation with https://github.com/elastic/java-ecs-logging. See <<log-correlation, docs>>.
* Avoid creating a temp agent file for each attachment {pull}859[#859]
* Instrument `View#render` instead of `DispatcherServlet#render` {pull}829[#829]
  This makes the transaction breakdown graph more useful. Instead of `dispatcher-servlet`, the graph now shows a type which is based on the view name, for example, `FreeMarker` or `Thymeleaf`.

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* Error in log when setting <<config-server-urls, server_urls>>
 to an empty string - `co.elastic.apm.agent.configuration.ApmServerConfigurationSource - Expected previousException not to be null`
* Avoid terminating the TCP connection to APM Server when polling for configuration updates {pull}823[#823]

[[release-notes-1.9.0]]
==== 1.9.0 - 2019/08/22

[float]
===== Features
* Upgrading supported OpenTracing version from 0.31 to 0.33
* Added annotation and meta-annotation matching support for `trace_methods`, for example:
** `public @java.inject.* org.example.*` (for annotation)
** `public @@javax.enterprise.context.NormalScope org.example.*` (for meta-annotation)
* The runtime attachment now also works when the `tools.jar` or the `jdk.attach` module is not available.
This means you don't need a full JDK installation - the JRE is sufficient.
This makes the runtime attachment work in more environments such as minimal Docker containers.
Note that the runtime attachment currently does not work for OSGi containers like those used in many application servers such as JBoss and WildFly.
See the <<setup-attach-cli, documentation>> for more information.
* Support for Hibernate Search

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* A warning in logs saying APM server is not available when using 1.8 with APM server 6.x.
Due to that, agent 1.8.0 will silently ignore non-string labels, even if used with APM server of versions 6.7.x or 6.8.x that support such.
If APM server version is <6.7 or 7.0+, this should have no effect. Otherwise, upgrade the Java agent to 1.9.0+.
* `ApacheHttpAsyncClientInstrumentation` matching increases startup time considerably
* Log correlation feature is active when `active==false`
* Tomcat's memory leak prevention mechanism is causing a... memory leak. JDBC statement map is leaking in Tomcat if the application that first used it is undeployed/redeployed.
See https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-apm-agent-jdbchelper-seems-to-use-a-lot-of-memory/195295[this related discussion].

[float]
==== Breaking Changes
* The `apm-agent-attach.jar` is not executable anymore.
Use `apm-agent-attach-standalone.jar` instead.

[[release-notes-1.8.0]]
==== 1.8.0 - 2019/07/30

[float]
===== Features
* Added support for tracking https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.3/transactions.html[time spent by span type].
   Can be disabled by setting https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/java/current/config-core.html#config-breakdown-metrics[`breakdown_metrics`] to `false`.
* Added support for https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.3/agent-configuration.html[central configuration].
   Can be disabled by setting <<config-central-config, `central_config`>> to `false`.
* Added support for Spring's JMS flavor - instrumenting `org.springframework.jms.listener.SessionAwareMessageListener`
* Added support to legacy ApacheHttpClient APIs (which adds support to Axis2 configured to use ApacheHttpClient)
* Added support for setting <<config-server-urls, `server_urls`>> dynamically via properties file {pull}723[#723]
* Added <<config-config-file, `config_file`>> option
* Added option to use `@javax.ws.rs.Path` value as transaction name <<config-use-jaxrs-path-as-transaction-name, `use_jaxrs_path_as_transaction_name`>>
* Instrument quartz jobs <<supported-scheduling-frameworks, docs>>
* SQL parsing improvements {pull}696[#696]
* Introduce priorities for transaction name {pull}748[#748].
   Now uses the path as transaction name if <<config-use-path-as-transaction-name, `use_path_as_transaction_name`>> is set to `true`
   rather than `ServletClass#doGet`.
   But if a name can be determined from a high level framework,
   like Spring MVC, that takes precedence.
   User-supplied names from the API always take precedence over any others.
* Use JSP path name as transaction name as opposed to the generated servlet class name {pull}751[#751]

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* Some JMS Consumers and Producers are filtered due to class name filtering in instrumentation matching
* Jetty: When no display name is set and context path is "/" transaction service names will now correctly fall back to configured values
* JDBC's `executeBatch` is not traced
* Drops non-String labels when connected to APM Server < 6.7 to avoid validation errors {pull}687[#687]
* Parsing container ID in cloud foundry garden {pull}695[#695]
* Automatic instrumentation should not override manual results {pull}752[#752]

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* The log correlation feature does not add `span.id` to the MDC anymore but only `trace.id` and `transaction.id` {pull}742[#742].

[[release-notes-1.7.0]]
==== 1.7.0 - 2019/06/13

[float]
===== Features
* Added the `trace_methods_duration_threshold` config option. When using the `trace_methods` config option with wild cards,
this enables considerable reduction of overhead by limiting the number of spans captured and reported
(see more details in config documentation).
NOTE: Using wildcards is still not the recommended approach for the `trace_methods` feature.
* Add `Transaction#addCustomContext(String key, String|Number|boolean value)` to public API
* Added support for AsyncHttpClient 2.x
* Added <<config-global-labels, `global_labels`>> configuration option.
This requires APM Server 7.2+.
* Added basic support for JMS- distributed tracing for basic scenarios of `send`, `receive`, `receiveNoWait` and `onMessage`.
Both Queues and Topics are supported.
Async `send` APIs are not supported in this version.
NOTE: This feature is currently marked as "experimental" and is disabled by default. In order to enable,
it is required to set the
<<config-disable-instrumentations, `disable_instrumentations`>>
configuration property to an empty string.
* Improved OSGi support: added a configuration option for `bootdelegation` packages {pull}641[#641]
* Better span names for SQL spans. For example, `SELECT FROM user` instead of just `SELECT` {pull}633[#633]

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* ClassCastException related to async instrumentation of Pilotfish Executor causing thread hang (applied workaround)
* NullPointerException when computing Servlet transaction name with null HTTP method name
* FileNotFoundException when trying to find implementation version of jar with encoded URL
* NullPointerException when closing Apache AsyncHttpClient request producer
* Fixes loading of `elasticapm.properties` for Spring Boot applications
* Fix startup error on WebLogic 12.2.1.2.0 {pull}649[#649]
* Disable metrics reporting and APM Server health check when active=false {pull}653[#653]

* Added the `jvm.thread.count` metric, indicating the number of live threads in the JVM (daemon and non-daemon)
* Added support for WebLogic
* Added support for Spring `@Scheduled` and EJB `@Schedule` annotations - https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/569[#569]

[float]

* Public API annotations improper retention prevents it from being used with Groovy - https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/567[#567]
* Eliminate side effects of class loading related to Instrumentation matching mechanism

[[release-notes-1.5.0]]
==== 1.5.0 - 2019/03/26

[float]
===== Potentially breaking changes
* If you didn't explicitly set the <<config-service-name, `service_name`>>
previously and you are dealing with a servlet-based application (including Spring Boot),
your `service_name` will change.
See the documentation for <<config-service-name[`service_name`]
and the corresponding section in _Features_ for more information.
Note: this requires APM Server 7.0+. If using previous versions, nothing will change.

[float]
===== Features
* Added property `"allow_path_on_hierarchy"` to JAX-RS plugin, to lookup inherited usage of `@path`
* Support for number and boolean labels in the public API {pull}497[497].
This change also renames `tag` to `label` on the API level to be compliant with the https://github.com/elastic/ecs#-base-fields[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)].
The `addTag(String, String)` method is still supported but deprecated in favor of `addLabel(String, String)`.
As of version 7.x of the stack, labels will be stored under `labels` in Elasticsearch.
Previously, they were stored under `context.tags`.
* Support async queries made by Elasticsearch REST client
* Added `setStartTimestamp(long epochMicros)` and `end(long epochMicros)` API methods to `Span` and `Transaction`,
allowing to set custom start and end timestamps.
* Auto-detection of the `service_name` based on the `<display-name>` element of the `web.xml` with a fallback to the servlet context path.
If you are using a spring-based application, the agent will use the setting for `spring.application.name` for its `service_name`.
See the documentation for <<config-service-name, `service_name`>>
for more information.
Note: this requires APM Server 7.0+. If using previous versions, nothing will change.
* Previously, enabling <<config-capture-body, `capture_body`>> could only capture form parameters.
Now it supports all UTF-8 encoded plain-text content types.
The option <<config-capture-body-content-types, `capture_body_content_types`>>
controls which `Content-Type`s should be captured.
* Support async calls made by OkHttp client (`Call#enqueue`)
* Added support for providing config options on agent attach.
** CLI example: `--config server_urls=http://localhost:8200,http://localhost:8201`
** API example: `ElasticApmAttacher.attach(Map.of("server_urls", "http://localhost:8200,http://localhost:8201"));`

[[release-notes-1.4.0]]
==== 1.4.0 - 2019/02/14

[float]
===== Features
* Added support for sync calls of OkHttp client
* Added support for context propagation for `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`s
* The `trace_methods` configuration now allows to omit the method matcher.
   Example: `com.example.*` traces all classes and methods within the `com.example` package and sub-packages.
* Added support for JSF. Tested on WildFly, WebSphere Liberty and Payara with embedded JSF implementation and on Tomcat and Jetty with
 MyFaces 2.2 and 2.3
* Introduces a new configuration option `disable_metrics` which disables the collection of metrics via a wildcard expression.
* Support for HttpUrlConnection
* Adds `subtype` and `action` to spans. This replaces former typing mechanism where type, subtype and action were all set through
   the type in an hierarchical dotted-syntax. In order to support existing API usages, dotted types are parsed into subtype and action,
   however `Span.createSpan` and `Span.setType` are deprecated starting this version. Instead, type-less spans can be created using the new
   `Span.startSpan` API and typed spans can be created using the new `Span.startSpan(String type, String subtype, String action)` API
* Support for JBoss EAP 6.4, 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2
* Improved startup times
* Support for SOAP (JAX-WS).
   SOAP client create spans and propagate context.
   Transactions are created for `@WebService` classes and `@WebMethod` methods.

* Fixed some OpenTracing bridge functionalities that were not working when auto-instrumentation is disabled
* Fixed an error occurring when ending an OpenTracing span before deactivating
* Sending proper `null` for metrics that have a NaN value
* Fixes JVM crash with Java 7 https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/issues/458[#458]
* Fixes an application deployment failure when using EclipseLink and `trace_methods` configuration https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/issues/474[#474]

[[release-notes-1.3.0]]

[float]
===== Features
* The agent now collects system and JVM metrics https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/360[#360]
* Add API methods `ElasticApm#startTransactionWithRemoteParent` and `Span#injectTraceHeaders` to allow for manual context propagation https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/396[#396].
* Added `trace_methods` configuration option which lets you define which methods in your project or 3rd party libraries should be traced.
   To create spans for all `public` methods of classes whose name ends in `Service` which are in a sub-package of `org.example.services` use this matcher:
   `public org.example.services.*.*Service#*` https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/398[#398]

[[release-notes-1.2.0]]
==== 1.2.0 - 2018/12/19

[float]
===== Features
* Added `capture_headers` configuration option.
   Set to `false` to disable capturing request and response headers.
   This will reduce the allocation rate of the agent and can save you network bandwidth and disk space.
* Makes the API methods `addTag`, `setName`, `setType`, `setUser` and `setResult` fluent, so that calls can be chained.

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* Catch all errors thrown within agent injected code
* Enable public APIs and OpenTracing bridge to work properly in OSGi systems, fixes https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/issues/362[this WildFly issue]
* Remove module-info.java to enable agent working on early Tomcat 8.5 versions
* Fix https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/issues/371[async Servlet API issue]

[[release-notes-1.0.1]]
==== 1.0.1 - 2018/11/15

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* Fixes NoSuchMethodError CharBuffer.flip() which occurs when using the Elasticsearch RestClient and Java 7 or 8 {pull}313[#313]

[[release-notes-1.0.0]]
==== 1.0.0 - 2018/11/14

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* Remove intake v1 support. This version requires APM Server 6.5.0+ which supports the intake api v2.
   Until the time the APM Server 6.5.0 is officially released,
   you can test with docker by pulling the APM Server image via
   `docker pull docker.elastic.co/apm/apm-server:6.5.0-SNAPSHOT`.

[float]
===== Features
* Adds `@CaptureTransaction` and `@CaptureSpan` annotations which let you declaratively add custom transactions and spans.
   Note that it is required to configure the `application_packages` for this to work.
   See the <<api-annotation, documentation>> for more information.
* The public API now supports to activate a span on the current thread.
   This makes the span available via `ElasticApm#currentSpan()`
   Refer to the <<api-span-activate, documentation>> for more details.
* Capturing of Elasticsearch RestClient 5.0.2+ calls.
   Currently, the `*Async` methods are not supported, only their synchronous counterparts.
* Added API methods to enable correlating the spans created from the JavaScrip Real User Monitoring agent with the Java agent transaction.
   More information can be found in the <<api-ensure-parent-id, documentation>>.
* Added `Transaction.isSampled()` and `Span.isSampled()` methods to the public API
* Added `Transaction#setResult` to the public API {pull}293[#293]

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* Fix for situations where status code is reported as `200`, even though it actually was `500` {pull}225[#225]
* Capturing the username now properly works when using Spring security {pull}183[#183]

[[release-notes-1.0.0.rc1]]
==== 1.0.0.RC1 - 2018/11/06

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* Remove intake v1 support. This version requires APM Server 6.5.0+ which supports the intake api v2.
   Until the time the APM Server 6.5.0 is officially released,
   you can test with docker by pulling the APM Server image via
   `docker pull docker.elastic.co/apm/apm-server:6.5.0-SNAPSHOT`.
* Wildcard patterns are case insensitive by default. Prepend `(?-i)` to make the matching case sensitive.

[float]
===== Features
* Support for Distributed Tracing
* Adds `@CaptureTransaction` and `@CaptureSpan` annotations which let you declaratively add custom transactions and spans.
   Note that it is required to configure the `application_packages` for this to work.
   See the <<api-annotation, documentation>> for more information.
* The public API now supports to activate a span on the current thread.
   This makes the span available via `ElasticApm#currentSpan()`
   Refer to the <<api-span-activate, documentation>> for more details.
* Capturing of Elasticsearch RestClient 5.0.2+ calls.
   Currently, the `*Async` methods are not supported, only their synchronous counterparts.
* Added API methods to enable correlating the spans created from the JavaScrip Real User Monitoring agent with the Java agent transaction.
   More information can be found in the <<api-ensure-parent-id, documentation>>.
* Microsecond accurate timestamps {pull}261[#261]
* Support for JAX-RS annotations.
Transactions are named based on your resources (`ResourceClass#resourceMethod`).

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* Fix for situations where status code is reported as `200`, even though it actually was `500` {pull}225[#225]

[[release-notes-0.8.x]]
=== Java Agent version 0.8.x

[[release-notes-0.8.0]]
==== 0.8.0

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* Wildcard patterns are case insensitive by default. Prepend `(?-i)` to make the matching case sensitive.

[float]
===== Features
* Wildcard patterns are now not limited to only one wildcard in the middle and can be arbitrarily complex now.
   Example: `*foo*bar*baz`.
* Support for JAX-RS annotations.
   Transactions are named based on your resources (`ResourceClass#resourceMethod`).

[[release-notes-0.7.x]]
=== Java Agent version 0.7.x

[[release-notes-0.7.1]]
==== 0.7.1 - 2018/10/24

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
* Avoid recycling transactions twice {pull}178[#178]

[[release-notes-0.7.0]]
==== 0.7.0 - 2018/09/12

[float]
===== Breaking changes
* Removed `ElasticApm.startSpan`. Spans can now only be created from their transactions via `Transaction#createSpan`.
* `ElasticApm.startTransaction` and `Transaction#createSpan` don't activate the transaction and spans
   and are thus not available via `ElasticApm.activeTransaction` and `ElasticApm.activeSpan`.

[float]
===== Features
* Public API
** Add `Span#captureException` and `Transaction#captureException` to public API.
      `ElasticApm.captureException` is deprecated now. Use `ElasticApm.currentSpan().captureException(exception)` instead.
** Added `Transaction.getId` and `Span.getId` methods
* Added support for async servlet requests
* Added support for Payara/Glassfish
* Incubating support for Apache HttpClient
* Support for Spring RestTemplate
* Added configuration options `use_path_as_transaction_name` and `url_groups`,
   which allow to use the URL path as the transaction name.
   As that could contain path parameters, like `/user/$userId` however,
   You can set the `url_groups` option to define a wildcard pattern, like `/user/*`,
   to group those paths together.
   This is especially helpful when using an unsupported Servlet API-based framework.
* Support duration suffixes (`ms`, `s` and `m`) for duration configuration options.
   Not using the duration suffix logs out a deprecation warning and will not be supported in future versions.
* Add ability to add multiple APM server URLs, which enables client-side load balancing.
   The configuration option `server_url` has been renamed to `server_urls` to reflect this change.
   However, `server_url` still works for backwards compatibility.
* The configuration option `service_name` is now optional.
   It defaults to the main class name,
   the name of the executed jar file (removing the version number),
   or the application server name (for example `tomcat-application`).
   In a lot of cases,
   you will still want to set the `service_name` explicitly.
   But it helps getting started and seeing data easier,
   as there are no required configuration options anymore.
   In the future we will most likely determine more useful application names for Servlet API-based applications.
