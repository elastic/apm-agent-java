# ================================================================

# Call this script with an SDK to grab. The initial list should
# be populated in the Jenkinsfile by executing the script in the
# `param_gen` directory.

# This script will download and unpack whatever SDK is requested
# and then return to the caller the complete name of the directory
# which should be available to set as JAVA_HOME.

# Example execution for retreiving the SDK:

# ./fetch_sdk.sh oracle-13+33-linux
#
# This script requires the following tooling to be available on the
# system path prior to execution:
#
# 1. cURL   [https://curl.haxx.se/] 
# 2. jq     [https://stedolan.github.io/jq/]
# 3. tar    [https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/]
