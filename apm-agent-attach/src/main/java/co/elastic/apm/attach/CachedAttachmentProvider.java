/**
 * Successive attachments with a {@code tools.jar}-based {@link net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.AttachmentProvider}
 * would lead to the {@link com.sun.tools.attach.VirtualMachine} class to be loaded from multiple class loaders
 * (see {@link net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.AttachmentProvider.ForStandardToolsJarVm#attempt()}).
 * That leads to a UnsatisfiedLinkError on Java 7 and 8 because the native library libattach can only be loaded by one class loader.
 * By caching the {@link net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.AttachmentProvider.Accessor},
 * the same VirtualMachine class is reused so that there is no attempt to load the libattach library from another class loader.
