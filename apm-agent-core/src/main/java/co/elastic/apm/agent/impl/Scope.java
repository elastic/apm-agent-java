/**
 * Within a scope, a {@link TraceContextHolder} is active on the current thread.
 * Calling {@link #close()} detaches them from the active thread.
 * In a scope, you can get the currently active {@link TraceContextHolder} via
 * {@link ElasticApmTracer#getActive()}.
 * <p>
 * During the duration of a {@link TraceContextHolder},
 * it can be active multiple times on multiple threads.
 * In applications with a single thread per request model,
 * there is typically one scope which lasts for the lifetime of the {@link TraceContextHolder}.
 * In reactive applications, this model does not work, as a request is handled in multiple threads.
 * These types of application still might find it useful to scope a {@link TraceContextHolder} on the currently processing thread.
 * For example, an instrumentation for {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} might want to propagate the currently
 * active {@link TraceContextHolder} to thread which runs {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService#execute(Runnable)},
 * so that {@link ElasticApmTracer#getActive()} returns the expected {@link TraceContextHolder}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: {@link #close() closing} a scope does not {@link co.elastic.apm.agent.impl.transaction.AbstractSpan#end() end} it's active
 * {@link co.elastic.apm.agent.impl.transaction.AbstractSpan}.
