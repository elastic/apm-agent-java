/**
 * Sleeping strategy that sleeps (<code>LockSupport.parkNanos(n)</code>) for an linearly increasing
 * number of nanos while the {@link com.lmax.disruptor.EventProcessor}s are waiting on a barrier.
 * <p>
 * This strategy consumes very little CPU resources.
 * However, latency spikes up to {@link #sleepTimeNsMax} will occur.
 * It will also reduce the impact on the producing thread as it will not need signal any conditional variables to wake up the event handling
 * thread.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The agent does not require to transfer events with low latency from producers to the consumer.
 * The primary concerns are low latency for adding events (to not block application threads) and low CPU consumption.
 * It does not matter if handling the events is a bit delayed.
 * The only caveat is that sudden traffic spikes after quiet periods can lead to loosing events.
 * If that should become a problem, take a look at the approaches outlined in
 * https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/issues/246 and https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-java/pull/1618.
 * In situations where the consumer is overloaded (always busy and awake) this wait strategy actually has very good latency
 * because consumers don't have to signal.
