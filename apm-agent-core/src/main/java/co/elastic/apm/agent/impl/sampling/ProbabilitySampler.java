/**
 * This implementation of {@link Sampler} samples based on a sampling probability (or sampling rate) between 0.0 and 1.0.
 * <p>
 * A sampling rate of 0.5 means that 50% of all transactions should be {@linkplain Sampler sampled}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation notes:
 * </p>
 * We are taking advantage of the fact, that the {@link Id} is randomly generated.
 * So instead of generating another random number,
 * we just see if the long value returned by {@link Id#getLeastSignificantBits()}
 * falls into the range between the {@code lowerBound} and the <code>higherBound</code>.
 * This is a visual representation of the mechanism with a sampling rate of 0.5 (=50%):
 * <pre>
 * Long.MIN_VALUE        0                     Long.MAX_VALUE
 * v                     v                     v
 * [----------[----------|----------]----------]
 *            ^                     ^
 *            lowerBound            higherBound = Long.MAX_VALUE * samplingRate
 *            = Long.MAX_VALUE * samplingRate * -1
