/**
 * This cache is useful in situations when hard referencing the cache key and the value would otherwise lead to memory or class loader leaks.
 * <p>
 * Use use-case is storing a value,
 * like a {@link Class} or {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle} which is specific to a certain {@link ClassLoader}.
 * Holding a strong reference to any of these from the agent code would lead to classloader leaks.
 * That's why the key is wrapped in a {@link java.lang.ref.WeakReference} and the value is wrapped in a {@link SoftReference}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An otherwise not referenced {@link ClassLoader} might still not be collected for a longer time as usual
 * if it is indirectly referenced by the value which is wrapped in a {@link SoftReference}.
 * But there is no danger of OOMEs, as the softly referenced value will be collected when memory gets scarce
 * or if it has not been accessed for some time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There can also be the situation that a value is collected although it is actually still used.
 * In that case, the value is re-loaded transparently.
 * For frequently accessed values that should not be the case,
 * as a {@link SoftReference} works a bit like a LRU cache
 * (see http://xmlandmore.blogspot.com/2014/12/jdk-8-when-softly-referenced-objects.html).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the cache key has been collected,
 * the underlying {@link WeakConcurrentMap} makes sure that the map entry is deleted.
