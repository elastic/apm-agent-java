/**
 * This class helps to overcome the fact that the agent classes can't access the classes they want to instrument.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * when the agent wants to access the classes of the Servlet API it can't,
 * as the agent is loaded by the bootstrap classloader and the Servlet API is loaded by a child classloader.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class creates a helper classloader whose parent is the classloader of the classes the agent needs to have access to.
 * The classes loaded by this helper classloader are called helper classes.
 * These helper classes can access the desired classes,
 * as they are defined by a parent classloader.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As the agent, which is loaded by the bootstrap classloader can't directly access the helper classes,
 * the agent defines a helper interface,
 * which is implemented by the helper class.
 * Therefore, the agent does not need to have access to the implementation type,
 * but can just refer to the interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because the helper classes are also available from the bootstrap classloader,
 * the classloaders created in this class have child-first semantics.
 * This makes sure that the loaded classes indeed have access to the types the helper classes refer to.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: trying to load the helper class implementations from the bootstrap classloader leads to {@link NoClassDefFoundError}s.
 * </p>

     * This helper class manager assumes that there is only one {@link ClassLoader} which loads the classes,
     * the helper class references.
     * <p>
     * This is true, for example, for the JDBC and the Servlet API.
     * There is only one canonical class for these types.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * However, this does not work if the helper class references types,
     * which can be loaded by multiple class loaders.
     * An example would be framework or library types,
     * which are part of an application deployed to a servlet container.
     * There could be multiple applications,
     * using the same type,
     * loaded by different application class loaders,
     * which makes them distinct runtime types.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note that the {@link #helperImplementation}'s classloader references the target classloader as it's parent.
     * This class does not weakly reference the {@link #helperImplementation}.
     * It is assumed that because there is only one classloader involved,
     * there can't be a leakage of this classloader by keeping around the {@link #helperImplementation}.
     * The situation would be differently when referring to types loaded by a web application classloader,
     * which has to be collectible when the web application is un-deployed.
