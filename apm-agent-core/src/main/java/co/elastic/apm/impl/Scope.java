/**
 * Within a scope, a {@link AbstractSpan} is active on the current thread.
 * Calling {@link #close()} detaches them from the active thread.
 * In a scope, you can get the currently active {@link AbstractSpan} via
 * {@link ElasticApmTracer#activeSpan()}.
 * <p>
 * During the duration of a {@link AbstractSpan},
 * it can be active multiple times on multiple threads.
 * In applications with a single thread per request model,
 * there is typically one scope which lasts for the lifetime of the {@link AbstractSpan}.
 * In reactive applications, this model does not work, as a request is handled in multiple threads.
 * These types of application still might find it useful to scope a {@link AbstractSpan} on the currently processing thread.
 * For example, an instrumentation for {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} might want to propagate the currently
 * active {@link AbstractSpan} to thread which runs {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService#execute(Runnable)},
 * so that {@link ElasticApmTracer#activeSpan()} returns the expected {@link AbstractSpan}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: {@link #close() closing} a scope does not {@link AbstractSpan#end() end} it's active {@link AbstractSpan}.
